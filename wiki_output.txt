John Francis Kieran (August 2, 1892 – December 10, 1981) was an American author, journalist, amateur naturalist and radio and television personality.


== Early years ==
A native of The Bronx, Kieran was the son of Dr. James M. Kieran and his wife, Katherine Donahue Kieran. Both of his parents were teachers, and his father was at one time president of Hunter College. He had three sisters and three brothers.Kieran earned a Bachelor of Science degree (cum laude) from Fordham University. After graduating, he became a poultry farmer and taught school.


== Career ==
Kieran began his newspaper career in 1915 as a sportswriter for The New York Times. He continued on the sports beat during his entire career, working for a number of New York City newspapers and becoming one of the country's best known sports columnists. On January 4, 1943, his column moved to the New York Sun. During his 1927–1943 tenure as The Times' senior sports columnist, he was profiled in the January 9, 1939, issue of Time magazine, which described him as "short, wiry, grey, bristly and brilliant".Although Kieran is widely credited with first applying the term "grand slam" to tennis, to describe the winning of all four major tennis tournaments in a calendar year, sports columnist Alan Gould had used the term in that connection almost two months before Kieran.A noted "intellectual", he gained extensive personal popularity with his 10-year stint as a panelist on NBC's most widely heard radio quiz program Information, Please! (May 17, 1938 – June 25, 1948). His seemingly encyclopedic erudition and quick wit, combined with an aura of gentle modesty, endeared him to the listening audience and assured his place on the show. Along with fellow "intellectuals" Franklin P. Adams and host Clifton Fadiman, Kieran entertained and educated radio audiences through the Great Depression, World War II and the Cold War.
Within eight months of Information, Please! leaving the air, Kieran entered the new medium of television with TV's first widely syndicated show John Kieran's Kaleidoscope. A 15-minute program produced from February 1949 to April 1952, John Kieran's Kaleidoscope presented its writer and host in his well-acquainted role as the learned and witty guide to the complexities of human knowledge. The 104 episodes touched on any and every subject  from the mating habits of insects to the properties of magnetic attraction to the theories surrounding the creation of the Solar System.
Kieran became a familiar face on 1950s television, guesting on numerous panel and quiz shows, including CBS' 13-week revival of Information, Please! as a 1952 summer replacement show, the only time it would be seen on TV.
A dedicated bird watcher and observer of the natural world, endowed with a breezy, colloquial writing style, Kieran enjoyed roaming Riverdale, his home area of the northwest Bronx, recording for posterity the changing scene at a time when the post-World War II housing boom was encroaching on, and eventually eliminating, formerly natural areas. His 1959 book A Natural History of New York City has continued to be read for its observations on local geography as well as birds, reptiles, fish "in troubled waters" and mammals within the city limits.
In 1964, at the age of 73, Kieran published his autobiography, Not Under Oath.


== Personal life ==
Kieran married Margaret Ford, a feature writer, September 15, 1947, in Brookline, Massachusetts. She was his second wife, his first wife having died five years earlier. A son, John Kieran Jr. (1921–2000), also appeared on 1950s TV, including a stint as a regular panelist in 1955 on another long-running quiz show, Down You Go. Kieran died on December 10, 1981, in Rockport, Massachusetts, at the age of 89 and is buried at Beech Grove Cemetery in Rockport.


=== Recognition ===
Kieran was inducted in the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 1971. In 1973, Kieran was honored by the Baseball Writers' Association of America with the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for distinguished baseball writing. Recipients of the Spink Award are recognized at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in what is commonly referred to as the "writers wing" of the Hall of Fame. In 1987, six years after his death, the New York City Parks Department inaugurated The John Kieran Nature Trail, which runs along some of the most scenic areas of the Bronx's Van Cortlandt Park. The trail is part of the former Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad.

20:20 was a planned box set release by singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, rumored to have a scheduled release in late 2007. Adams stated that the box set would include albums that he "really wanted to be records."


== Background ==
According to Adams, the box set was to include five unreleased albums: The Suicide Handbook, 48 Hours, Pink Hearts, Darkbreaker and Black Hole. Adams stated that the five albums would be: "collected into a box-set called 20:20. There'll also be a couple of disks, one of rare stuff that nobody has heard and one of b-sides from all the singles that we made. It will be interesting to get all that stuff in one place."Cardinals member and frequent collaborator, James Candiloro, was said to be compiling the box set, while author Stephen King wrote the liner notes.As of September 2023 the boxset remains unreleased.


== The albums ==
Ryan has stated that The Suicide Handbook was made for Lost Highway as the follow-up to Heartbreaker and called it his "most majestic piece ever." 48 Hours was recorded after Gold in forty-eight hours, hence the title, and is in the country rock genre. Pink Hearts, or The Pink Hearts Sessions, is named for his "Nashville Punk" band The Pink Hearts with whom he toured Gold. Darkbreaker was made in L.A. after Jacksonville City Nights (2005) and is, according to Adams, the sound of him "falling apart." The album contains songs that were recorded for the Cameron Crowe movie Elizabethtown but not used. The final album to be included was Black Hole which Adams called "a real serious effort to make a rock record" and confirms that it was the last album he recorded "in the last days of the drugs." Adams told the NME in 2014 that the album was a "really cool" composite of two recorded versions of the album and was considering releasing it for Record Store Day 2015. In the end Adams did not follow this plan through, re-releasing "Come Pick Me Up" instead.

"Peter Pan" is a song co-written and recorded by American recording artist Kelsea Ballerini. It was released to American country radio by Black River Entertainment as the third single from her debut studio album The First Time (2015). Ballerini co-wrote the song with Forest Glen Whitehead and Jesse Lee. The track is a country pop ballad about a lost love being compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for being immature and having a tendency to run off to his own fantasy.
"Peter Pan" peaked at number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts respectively, becoming Ballerini's first to hit the top of the former, and her third consecutive on the latter chart. It makes her the first female country music artist to top both country music charts at the same time. It also made her the first female country artist since Wynonna Judd in 1992 to send their first three singles to number one. It also charted at number 35 on the Hot 100. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 672,000 copies in the US as of March 2017. It achieved similar chart prominence in Canada, peaking at number four on the Canada Country chart and number 75 on the Canadian Hot 100. It garnered a Gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 units in that country.
An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Kristin Barlowe, features Ballerini watching in terror as her boyfriend does thrill-seeking stunts in cars, motorcycles, and planes out in the Las Vegas desert. It was nominated for Video of the Year at both the 2017 Academy of Country Music and CMT Music Awards. For promotion, Ballerini first performed the song live with Nick Jonas at the Academy of Country Music Awards and would make later appearances at the 2016 Radio Disney Music Awards with Daya, Live with Kelly and Michael, the Grand Ole Opry, the 59th Annual Grammy Awards with Lukas Graham and CMT Crossroads with Halsey.


== Background and development ==
"Peter Pan" is a country pop song about a lost love, who is compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for his immaturity and tendency to run away. The ballad has been noted by critics for showcasing a greater emotional depth than Ballerini's previous releases in terms of both lyrical complexity and performance. In a 2019 interview with American Songwriter, co-writer Jesse Lee said that she had the song idea "six months prior" to writing it, jotting down the hook ("You're never gonna grow up, you're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan.") on her phone. Lee told co-producer Forest Glen Whitehead and Kelsea Ballerini about the hook, and they started crafting the song moving forward, writing the first verse in a few minutes and spending a majority on the chorus and the second verse. After finishing the writing process that day, they went on to record the song, with both Lee and Whitehead providing background vocals.


== Reception ==


=== Critical ===
The staff of country music blog Taste of Country praised Ballerini's emotive performance of the song, writing that "the singer either performs the ballad with someone in mind, or she's country music's best actress," and also noted that the song confirms Ballerini's talent as a songwriter. In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin put "Peter Pan" at number two on his top 10 list of Ballerini's best songs.


=== Commercial ===
"Peter Pan" ranked as the most-added song on country radio for the week of March 26, 2016 with 50 Mediabase-monitored stations picking up the song. It resultantly debuted at number 54 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of April 2 and peaked at number one the week of September 23, making it her third consecutive number one on that chart. A week later, it debuted at number 47 on the Hot Country Songs chart and peaked at number one the week of September 23, making it her first number one on that chart. The achievement made Ballerini the first solo female artist to top both country music charts and also send their first three singles to number one since Wynonna Judd in 1992 with "She Is His Only Need", "I Saw the Light" and "No One Else on Earth". On the Billboard Hot 100, the single debuted at number 92 the week of June 16. Fourteen weeks later, it peaked at number 35 the same week it topped both Country charts, and stayed on the chart for twenty weeks. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 21, 2016. The song has sold 672,000 copies in the US as of March 2017.In Canada, the song debuted at number 46 on the Canada Country chart for the week of June 11, 2016 and peaked at number four the week of September 23, remaining on the chart for twenty weeks. It also debuted at number 92 on the Canadian Hot 100 the week of August 20 and reached number 75 the week of September 23, staying on the chart for ten weeks. It was certified gold by Music Canada on September 12, 2016.


=== Accolades ===


== Music video ==
A lyric video premiered on Ballerini's Vevo account on May 18, 2015. The official music video premiered on Ballerini's Vevo account on April 1, 2016. Directed by Kristin Barlowe, the video takes place in the Las Vegas desert with Ballerini looking on in terror as her boyfriend does thrill-seeking stunts in cars, motorcycles and planes.
In the beginning, Ballerini delivers some dialogue about her boyfriend before going straight to the song. She then dons her other dresses while blowing in the wind and in the next shot, she is seen dancing behind a white parachute. Ballerini later confronts her boyfriend after doing a stunt on a plane and at the end of the video, he flies away one last time while Ballerini drives down the road in a car. The on-screen boyfriend is played by American model Nick Davis.


== Live performances ==
On April 3, 2016, Ballerini first performed the song live at the 2016 Academy of Country Music Awards with Nick Jonas on guitar as part of a medley with "Love Me Like You Mean It". Midway through the performance, Jonas botched a guitar solo that he later admitted he screwed up two days later. On May 1, it was performed at the 2016 Radio Disney Music Awards with Daya as a mashup with her song "Hide Away". On May 13, she performed the song on Live with Kelly and Michael. On August 10, it was performed again at the Grand Ole Opry, and after the performance she was given a plaque to celebrate the song being certified Gold.

The Scouts Battalion (Estonian: Scoutspataljon) is a battalion of the Estonian Land Forces. It is a part of the 1st Infantry Brigade and acts as its rapid response unit. The battalion is currently based at Tapa.


== History ==


=== Estonian War of Independence ===
In November 1918, Estonian American entrepreneur and scouting enthusiast Henry Reissar returned to Estonia and turned to the Ministry of Defence (then Ministry of War) with a proposition of forming a voluntary military unit, financed by himself, in order to help defend Estonia. Having received such permission, the unit was formed on 21 December 1918, in Viljandi, where the first volunteers took their oaths in the ruins of Viljandi Castle, and Friedrich-Karl Pinka was appointed commander of the newly formed unit. On 3 January 1919, the company-sized unit was sent to the front against the Red Army. On 23 January 1919, a 43-man unit of Scouts captured the Pikksaare Train Station, defended by 524 Red Army troops. The Scouts fought mostly alongside armoured train units and acquitted themselves well in combat, manifesting greater morale than the regular conscript units. The Scouts took part in several major battles including the attack against the Krasnaya Gorka fort in October 1919 and the Battle of Krivasoo in November – December 1919. On 1 December 1919, the Scouts Regiment (Estonian: Scoutspolk) was formed as a part of the Armoured Train Division.


=== 1920–1940 ===
After the signing of the Peace Treaty of Tartu, many servicemen were demobilized and returned to civilian life. From 1921-28, the Scouts unit was reduced in size and continued to serve as a part of the 2nd, 5th, 6th and 10th Infantry Regiment. On 1 October 1928, the unit was renamed Scouts Single Infantry Battalion. The battalion was based at Tallinn, from where it was moved to Uuemõisa in 1932. After the Soviet occupation in 1940, the battalion was disbanded.


=== 2001–present ===
The Scouts Battalion was restored on 29 March 2001, as a fully professional unit. The Scouts Battalion has actively participated in international operations together with other NATO, European Union and United Nations member states, including the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. The battalion is currently equipped with Combat Vehicle 90 infantry fighting vehicles and Patria Pasi armoured personnel carriers.

The 2019–20 season was the 122nd in the history of Northern Football League, a football competition in England. The allocations for Steps 1 to 6 for season 2019–20 were announced by the FA on 19 May. These were subject to appeal, and the Northern League's constitution was ratified at the league's annual general meeting (AGM) on 15 June.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, this season's competition was formally abandoned on 26 March 2020, with all results from the season being expunged, and no promotion or relegation taking place to, from, or within the competition. On 30 March 2020, sixty-six non-league clubs sent an open letter to the Football Association requesting that they reconsider their decision. A legal appeal against the decision, funded by South Shields of the Northern Premier League, was dismissed later in June.

The Compaq Concerto was a detachable laptop computer made by Compaq, introduced in 1993. Concerto was the first tablet computer manufactured by Compaq on a large scale, and can be considered a very early form of a 2-in-1 PC.


== Specifications ==
There were three Concerto models, varying in hard disk capacity, and processor speed.  All had 4 MB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which was expandable to 20 MB using proprietary memory modules.
There were two processor options: Intel 486SL @ 25 MHz or 33 MHz.  The 25-MHz model was available with either a 120-MB or 240-MB IDE hard disk drive, and the 33-MHz model had a 240-MB IDE hard disk drive.  Both models had a built in 3.5" 1.44-MB floppy disk drive.
All models shipped with MS-DOS 6.2, with Compaq's unique set of DOS extensions for power management, configuration and model specific help.  Windows for PEN Computing Version 1, which was Windows 3.1 with necessary add-ons for pen operation — including handwriting recognition - was also pre-installed. The Concerto was made with some help from Wacom and their associates

Modem: Internal modem was available as add-on
PCMCIA: two Type II PCMCIA slots, could also be used as a single Type III PCMCIA slot
Docking Station: a Concerto specific docking station was availableThe Concerto was not a very successful laptop, but it did have some special features: a detachable keyboard, and a pen & touch screen (the touch screen only worked with the special pen).  It could be considered to be ahead of its time.
Its screen had Wacom functionality as mentioned above

The pen had a button which could produce a double-click or right-click.  (Touching the screen gave a single-click.)
The position of the pen could be detected, and the correctly placed pointer could be displayed, even when the pen was up to 1 cm away from the screen.  This could e.g. trigger tooltip text display in newer operating systems.The Concerto was a unique design, in as much as it was "upside-down" - the main body including the motherboard, hard disk drive, floppy disk drive, and expansion slots were behind the screen.  The detachable keyboard was used as the lid but could be completely removed, at which point the Concerto became what is known as a slate PC.  The pen was connected to the Concerto through an RF link, and there was a compartment in the Concerto for the pen.

KFYO originally occupied the 1340 frequency in Lubbock, but moved to 790 AM in January 1953. The call sign was changed to KLBK on June 1, 1962; to KSAX on May 14, 1980; to KKAM on December 6, 1980; to KBBL and then KFMX in 1984; to KMKM and then back to KFMX in November 1988, and back to KKAM on April 1, 1993.KKAM became Lubbock's first all-sports radio station in November 1996, segueing from a news/talk/sports/ag news format. The station was branded "SportsRadio 1340 KKAM". At the time of its format switch it was one of the first four all-sports radio stations in Texas; joining KTCK in Dallas, KILT in Houston and KTKR in San Antonio. Personalities that have worked at KKAM throughout its history include Ryan Hyatt, Mark Finkner, Jack Dale, Steve Dale, Don Williams (from the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal), Scott Fitzgerald (Texas Tech University graduate, not the radio host who has worked for WBT and WERC-FM), Johnny May, Paul R. Beane, Bill Maddux, Jim Stewart and Misty.
KKAM became the flagship radio station for Texas Tech Red Raiders football, men's basketball and baseball in the 1994-95 athletic season, through Loyd Senn's All Sports Radio Network (ASRN).  The change ended the streak established by KFYO as Texas Tech's flagship radio station, that was started with its first broadcast of Texas Tech football in the 1940s. During KKAM's tenure as the Texas Tech flagship, football games were simulcast on KFMX and men's basketball games simulcast on 99.5 FM, the present-day KQBR. KKAM remained the flagship radio station for Texas Tech Football, Men's Basketball and Baseball through the 2008-09 athletic season.
On May 4, 2009, KKAM rebranded itself "SportsRadio 1340 The Fan" and added Dan Patrick, Jim Rome and Tony Bruno to the daily lineup. On May 28, 2009, KKAM changed network affiliations from ESPN Radio to Sporting News Radio. At the end of December 2012 the Williams and Hyatt Show left the station.  In February 2013, SportsRadio 1340 The Fan changed network affiliations again, switching from Yahoo! Sports Radio (the former Sporting News Radio) to CBS Sports Radio. The Dan Patrick Show and Jack Dale's Sportsline, hosted by Steve Dale, remained a part of the daily lineup.
In February 2017, KKAM added the Fox Sports Radio programs hosted by Clay Travis and Colin Cowherd to the daily lineup.
On December 29, 2017, Steve Dale hosted the last edition of Sportsline on the station, moving the program online. On January 2, 2018, Weston Odom took over hosting duties of KKAMn's local morning show, weekdays from 7 am-9 am. On October 15, 2018, The Rob Breaux Show with Rob Breaux and Karson Robinson became The Fan's local morning show, weekdays 7 am-9 am.
On October 22, 2018, KKAM announced a multi-year affiliation with the Kansas City Chiefs Radio Network, coinciding with the emergence of Texas Tech alum Patrick Mahomes as the team's star quarterback. Chiefs games would begin airing on 1340 The Fan for the remainder for the 2018 season.
On January 4, 2019, 1340 The Fan re-branded as "Talk 1340". The station is no longer all-sports, with Texas State Network news, ABC News Radio and select news/talk shows added to the lineup. The Rob Breaux Show with Karson Robinson moved to 9 am-11 am, weekdays, and Ryan Hyatt rejoined KKAM to host Raiderland Radio, weekdays 11 am-12 pm.

The Man Who Could Be Santa is a Christmas book for children written by Emmy Award winning journalist Joanna Wolper. The book is published by Royal Fireworks Press.


== Plot ==
The story is told from the point of view of 6¾-year-old Abby who insists she will believe in Santa Claus even when she is in “the hundredth grade.”
She and her cousins form a “spy club” to find out if the man who lives down the street with the long white beard, a "belly that shakes like jelly" and a bunch of reindeer in his front yard is the same person who slides down their chimneys every Christmas.
The three young detectives find other clues: a Christmas tree farm down the road, a ham radio that receives messages from the North Pole and remote control model air planes which deliver toys to children all over the world.


== Language ==
The author, Joanna Wolper, used documentary film techniques to make certain the children’s dialogue was authentic. She conducted classroom workshops with over a hundred students in second, third and fourth grade classes.
The young students discarded what they called “parent words.” They  also discussed how they liked stories where they could  “escape to imaginary places that were safe.” They also wanted characters “who they could be friends with.” No matter where in the world the children came from they all wanted to believe in Santa Claus.

Bradley Graeme Barnes (born 20 October 1988) is a South African cricketer who plays for the Cape Cobras. Barnes is a wicket-keeper and a versatile right-handed batsman who can open the batting or bat in the middle order.


== 2008 U-19 Cricket World Cup ==
Barnes featured in the 2008 U-19 Cricket World Cup scoring a reasonable 59 runs in four innings during the tournament at an average of 29.50, as well as effecting 9 dismissals as a wicket-keeper. However, the U-19 South Africans lost to India in the final by 12 runs by Duckworth/Lewis method.


== Domestic career ==
Barnes signed up with the Dolphins after the U-19 Cricket World Cup, and also played amateur cricket for Kwa-Zulu Natal. However, chances to represent the Dolphins were restricted due to the more established wicket-keeper Daryn Smit's success. Frustrated, Barnes moved to the Cape Cobras at the start of the 2012/13 season in search of more opportunities.

Robert Crowther Abbott  (1869–1927) was the inaugural Bishop of Sherborne.
Robert Crowther Abbott was born into a clerical family: his father was the Rev. A. R. Abbott, sometime Vicar of Gorleston. He was educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After 15 years as an assistant master (and latterly chaplain) at his old school he was appointed principal of Salisbury Theological College in 1907. After incumbencies at Great St Mary's with St Michael's, Cambridge,  Holy Trinity, Weymouth, Dorset and St Mary the Virgin, Gillingham, Dorset he was elevated to the episcopate in 1925, but ill health forced his resignation only two years later.


== Notes ==
Escherichia coli (; commonly abbreviated E. coli) is a Gram-negative gammaproteobacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms).  The descendants of two isolates, K-12 and B strain, are used routinely in molecular biology as both a tool and a model organism.


== Diversity ==

Escherichia coli is one of the most diverse bacterial species, with several pathogenic strains with different symptoms and with only 20% of the genome common to all strains. Furthermore, from the evolutionary point of view, the members of genus Shigella (dysenteriae, flexneri, boydii, sonnei) are actually E. coli strains "in disguise" (i.e. E. coli is paraphyletic to the genus).


== History ==
In 1885, Theodor Escherich, a German pediatrician, first discovered this species in the feces of healthy individuals and called it Bacterium coli commune because it is found in the colon and early classifications of Prokaryotes placed these in a handful of genera based on their shape and motility (at that time Ernst Haeckel's classification of Bacteria in the kingdom Monera was in place).Following a revision of Bacteria it was reclassified as Bacillus coli by Migula in 1895 and later reclassified as Escherichia coli.Due to its ease of culture and fast doubling, it was used in the early microbiology experiments; however, bacteria were considered primitive and pre-cellular and received little attention before 1944, when Avery, Macleod and McCarty demonstrated that DNA was the genetic material using Salmonella typhimurium, following which Escherichia coli was used for linkage mapping studies.


== Strains ==
Four of the many E. coli strains (K-12, B, C, and W) are thought of as model organism strains. These are classified in Risk Group 1 in biosafety guidelines.


=== Escherich's isolate ===
The first isolate of Escherich was deposited in NCTC in 1920 by the Lister Institute in London (NCTC 86 [1] Archived 2011-07-25 at the Wayback Machine).


=== K-12 ===
A strain was isolated from a stool sample of a patient convalescent from diphtheria and was labelled K-12 (not an antigen) in 1922 at Stanford University. This isolate was used in 1940s by Charles E. Clifton to study nitrogen metabolism, who deposited it in ATCC (strain ATCC 10798 Archived 2011-07-25 at the Wayback Machine) and lent it to Edward Tatum for his tryptophan biosynthesis experiments, despite its idiosyncrasies due to the F+ λ+ phenotype.
In the course of the passages it lost its O antigen and in 1953 was cured first of its lambda phage (strain W1485 Archived 2011-07-25 at the Wayback Machine by UV by Joshua Lederberg and colleagues) and then in 1985 of the F plasmid by acridine orange curing. Strains derived from MG1655 include DH1, parent of DH5α and in turn of DH10B (rebranded as TOP10 by Invitrogen).
An alternative lineage from W1485 is that of W2637 (which contains an inversion rrnD-rrnE), which in turn resulted in W3110.
Due to the lack of specific record-keeping, the "pedigree" of strains was not available and had to be inferred by consulting lab-book and records in order to set up the E. coli Genetic Stock Centre at Yale by Barbara Bachmann. The different strains have been derived through treating E. coli K-12 with agents such as nitrogen mustard, ultra-violet radiation, X-ray etc. An extensive list of Escherichia coli K-12 strain derivatives and their individual construction, genotypes, phenotypes, plasmids and phage information can be viewed at Ecoliwiki.


=== B strain ===
A second common laboratory strain is the B strain, whose history is less straightforward and the first naming of the strain as E. coli B was by Delbrück and Luria in 1942 in their study of bacteriophages T1 and T7. The original E. coli B strain, known then as Bacillus coli, originated from Félix d'Herelle from the Institut Pasteur in
Paris around 1918 who studied bacteriophages, who claimed that it originated from Collection of the Institut Pasteur, but no strains of that period exist. The strain of d'Herelle was passed to Jules Bordet, Director of the Institut Pasteur du Brabant in Bruxelles and his student André Gratia. The former passed the strain to Ann Kuttner ("the Bact. coli obtained
from Dr. Bordet") and in turn to Eugène Wollman (B. coli Bordet), whose son deposited it in 1963 (CIP 63.70) as "strain BAM" (B American), while André Gratia passed the strain to Martha Wollstein, a researcher at Rockefeller, who refers to the strain as "Brussels strain of Bacillus coli" in 1921, who in turn passed it to Jacques Bronfenbrenner (B. coli P.C.), who passed it to Delbrück and Luria.
This strain gave rise to several other strains, such as REL606 and BL21.


=== C strain ===
E. coli C is morphologically distinct from other E. coli strains; it is more spherical in shape and has a distinct distribution of its nucleoid.


=== W strain ===
The W strain was isolated from the soil near Rutgers University by Selman Waksman.


== Role in biotechnology ==
Because of its long history of laboratory culture and ease of manipulation, E. coli also plays an important role in modern biological engineering and industrial microbiology. The work of Stanley Norman Cohen and Herbert Boyer in E. coli, using plasmids and restriction enzymes to create recombinant DNA, became a foundation of biotechnology.Considered a very versatile host for the production of heterologous proteins, researchers can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids, allowing for the mass production of proteins in industrial fermentation processes. Genetic systems have also been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins using E. coli. One of the first useful applications of recombinant DNA technology was the manipulation of E. coli to produce human insulin. Modified E. coli have been used in vaccine development, bioremediation, and production of immobilised enzymes.E. coli have been used successfully to produce proteins previously thought difficult or impossible in E. coli, such as those containing multiple disulfide bonds or those requiring post-translational modification for stability or function.  The cellular environment of E. coli is normally too reducing for disulphide bonds to form, proteins with disulphide bonds therefore may be secreted to its periplasmic space, however, mutants in which the reduction of both thioredoxins and glutathione is impaired also allow disulphide bonded proteins to be produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli.  It has also been used to produce proteins with various post-translational modifications, including glycoproteins by using the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni engineered into E. coli.  Efforts are currently under way to expand this technology to produce complex glycosylations.Studies are also being performed into programming E. coli to potentially solve complicated mathematics problems such as the Hamiltonian path problem.


== Model organism ==
E. coli is frequently used as a model organism in microbiology studies. Cultivated strains (e.g. E. coli K-12) are well-adapted to the laboratory environment, and, unlike wild type strains, have lost their ability to thrive in the intestine. Many lab strains lose their ability to form biofilms. These features protect wild type strains from antibodies and other chemical attacks, but require a large expenditure of energy and material resources.In 1946, Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum first described the phenomenon known as bacterial conjugation using E. coli as a model bacterium, and it remains a primary model to study conjugation. E. coli was an integral part of the first experiments to understand phage genetics, and early researchers, such as Seymour Benzer, used E. coli and phage T4 to understand the topography of gene structure. Prior to Benzer's research, it was not known whether the gene was a linear structure, or if it had a branching pattern.E. coli was one of the first organisms to have its genome sequenced; the complete genome of E. coli K-12 was published by Science in 1997.


== Lenski's long-term evolution experiment ==

The long-term evolution experiments using E. coli, begun by Richard Lenski in 1988, have allowed direct observation of major evolutionary shifts in the laboratory. In this experiment, one population of E. coli unexpectedly evolved the ability to aerobically metabolize citrate. This capacity is extremely rare in E. coli. As the inability to grow aerobically is normally used as a diagnostic criterion with which to differentiate E. coli from other, closely related bacteria such as Salmonella, this innovation may mark a speciation event observed in the lab.

Clemmensen reduction is a chemical reaction described as a reduction of ketones or aldehydes to alkanes using zinc amalgam and concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). This reaction is named after Erik Christian Clemmensen, a Danish-American chemist.
Clemmensen reduction conditions are particularly effective at reducing aryl-alkyl ketones, such as those formed in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The two-step sequence of Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by Clemmensen reduction constitutes a classical strategy for the primary alkylation of arenes.  


== Mechanism ==
Despite the reaction being first discovered in 1914, the mechanism of the Clemmensen reduction remains obscure. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the reaction, mechanistic studies are difficult, and only a handful of studies have been disclosed. Mechanistic proposals generally invoke organozinc intermediates, sometimes including zinc carbenoids, either as discrete species or as organic fragments bound to the zinc metal surface. Brewster proposed the possibility of the reduction occurring at the metal surface. Depending on the constitution of the carbonyl compound or the acidity of the reaction, a carbon-metal or oxygen-metal bond can form after the compound attaches to the metal surface. Furthermore, Vedeja proposed a mechanism involving the formation of radical anion and zinc carbenoid, followed by reduction to alkane (as shown above). However, alcohol and carbanion are not believed to be intermediates, since exposing alcohol to Clemmensen conditions rarely affords the alkane product.


== Application ==
Highly symmetrical hydrocarbon compounds have attracted much interest due to their beautiful structure and potential applications, but the challenges in the synthesis persist. Suzuki et al. synthesized dibarrelane, a type of hydrocarbon compound, using Clemmensen reduction. They hypothesized that the secondary alcohol underwent an SN1 reaction, forming a chloride. Then, an excess amount of zinc reduced the chloride. Importantly, the reaction effectively reduced the two ketones, alcohol, and the methoxycarbonyl group while avoiding any by-products, giving the product in high yield (61%).

Clemmensen reduction is not particularly effective with aliphatic or cyclic ketones. A modified condition, involving activated zinc dust in an anhydrous-solution of hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether or acetic anhydride, results in a more effective reduction.The modified Clemmensen reduction allows for the selective deoxygenation of ketones in molecules that contain stable groups such as cyano, amido, acetoxy, and carboalkoxy. Yamamura et al. effectively reduced cholestane-3-one to cholestane using the modified Clemmensen condition and gave the product in high yield (~76%).


== Problems and alternative approaches ==
To perform the Clemmensen reduction, the substrate must be tolerant of the strongly acidic conditions of the reaction (37% HCl). Several alternatives are available. Wolff-Kishner reduction can reduce acid-sensitive substrates that are stable to strong bases. For substrates stable to hydrogenolysis in the presence of Raney nickel, a milder two-step Mozingo reduction method is available.

The site consists of the remains of a large wreck, probably Swedish, a cargo vessel dating from some time after its coinage of 1787. To bear such coinage only it may have been wrecked at latest about twenty years later. It was in good condition with surviving timbers, wine bottles, and Swedish copper plate money.


== Discovery and investigation ==
The site was discovered in 1976 when the Port of London Authority were dredging the South Edinburgh Channel. Further investigation was undertaken in 1977 which resulted in the recovering of the wine and coins.

== History ==
According to the history of the Passamaquoddy Indians, the Ellsworth area was originally inhabited by members of the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes: "Both groups speak closely related Algonquian languages, although anthropologists generally group the Passamaquoddies linguistically with the Maliseets and the Penobscots with the Abenakis." History
George J. Varney, in the 'Hancock County, Maine' section of his Gazetteer of the State of Maine, published in Boston in 1886, wrote:

"The first European who made definite mention of the Penobscot Bay and river, which wash its western side, was Thevet, a French explorer, in 1556. Martin Pring and Captain Weymouth, the English explorers, sailed along its shores in 1603 and 1605, and DeMonts, the Frenchman, explored some portions of the coast in 1604 and 1605. There is a tradition that Rosier, the historian of Weymouth's expedition, explored Deer Island thoroughfare, making a halt at the bold promontory in Brooksville, known as Cape Rosier. They found the county occupied by a tribe of Indians, who with those on Passamaquoddy waters, were noted for their long journeys in canoes; whence the general name for these Indians, Etechmins. DeMonts claimed the country in the name of the King of France in the true Catholic style, setting up a cross and calling the country "Acadie." By this name it continued to be known until the capture of Quebec by General James Wolfe in 1759. When Weymouth came in 1605, he also claimed the country in the name of his King, James I of England. Thus the two leading powers of Europe became adverse claimants of the soil of Hancock County, and the wars these claims occasioned kept the county an almost unbroken wilderness during the provincial history of Maine."It is likely that the French who founded a colony at Somes Sound on Mount Desert Island in 1613, under the patronage of Madame de Guercheville, explored the Ellsworth area and what is now the watershed of the Union River. Varney believes that there were French settlements of some kind or another as close to Ellsworth as Trenton, Oak Point, Newbury Neck and Surry.
The Ellsworth area was disputed between the English and the French throughout the 17th century and well into the 18th century, occasioning intermittent warfare which was known to the English as the French and Indian Wars. Native American inhabitants may have converted to Roman Catholicism and fought with the French against the British until the fall of Quebec City to the British in 1759. After the 1763 signing of the Treaty of Paris by the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal, Ellsworth became part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The modern history of Ellsworth begins with the settlement of the Union River area around 1763 by a party of English led by entrepreneurs Benjamin Milliken and Benjamin Joy, from present-day southern Maine and New Hampshire, who intended to build dams and sawmills to exploit the area's timber and water power. They applied for grants offered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to encourage settlement of the Hancock County area. Historian Albert H. Davis in his History of Ellsworth, Maine, published in Lewiston, Maine, in 1927, relates what is known of this early expedition and points to the northern end of the present Water Street, just to the south of the present bridge across the Union River, as the site of the earlier crude buildings erected by the pioneers.
George J. Varney describes the process of land grants by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:

"The first grants of land in the county were six townships, each six miles square, between the rivers Penobscot and Union (then known as the Donaqua), which were granted to David Marsh et al., by the General Court of Massachusetts, upon conditions, one of which was that they should settle each township with 60 Protestant families within six years. These grants were No. 1, Bucksport; 2, Orland; 3, Penobscot; 4, Sedgwick; 5, Blue Hill; and 6, Surry. Six other townships east of the Union River were granted on the same terms; three of which are in this county, viz.: No. 1, Trenton, granted to Eben Thorndike, et al.; 2, Sullivan, to David Bean, et al.; and 3, Mount Desert (Island) to Governor Bernard. The surveys were made by Samuel Livermore; and as there were three of the townships on each side of the river, it gave rise to the name which the stream now bears."In 1773 the first schooner was built at Ellsworth. This was the Susan and Abigail, named after daughters of the two most prominent citizens, American Loyalist Benjamin Milliken and Benjamin Joy. The vessel carried pine shingles and oak staves in annual voyages to the West Indies. In the years up to the beginning of the 20th century, many schooners of various sizes were built in Ellsworth shipyards along the Union River.
Albert Davis records that in the latter part of the 18th century, Ellsworth was known as the Union River Settlement and was adjacent to the settlements of Surry (to the east) and Trenton (to the south). Later it was organized as Plantation No. 7 and at times called Bowdoin and New Bowdoin. In 1798 the inhabitants petitioned to be incorporated under the name Sumner. That name having been already taken by a settlement in present-day Oxford County, Maine, the town was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1800 as Ellsworth, named for Oliver Ellsworth, the Connecticut delegate to the 1787 National Convention that was then working on a Constitution for the new United States of America, and later the third Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Oliver Ellsworth is thought to be first to suggest the name "United States of America".
Davis reports that in the late 1770s, there were British raids on the Union River Settlement, with attempts to appropriate local cattle. However, there were no formal battles in the Ellsworth area during the Revolutionary War.
In 1838, Ellsworth became the county seat of Hancock County, replacing Castine. The 1838 county buildings still stand, west of the Union River, on Bridge Hill.
In 1859, when the town's population was 4,009, industries included nine sawmills, two gristmills, one tannery, one carding machine, one pottery maker, eight brickyards, thirteen shipbuilders, five pail factories, two edge tool factories, one carriage manufacturer and eight box-making establishments.Between 1860 and 1865, Ellsworth sent 653 soldiers to fight in the Civil War, according to historian Albert Davis. This was at a time when there were only 847 (male) voters in the area. Military training was held in front of the county buildings on Bridge Hill, west of the Union River, at the site of the present Civil War Monument.
In 1869, Ellsworth was incorporated as a city by the Maine Legislature. The first City Hall was Hancock Hall, which stood at the corner of Main Street and School Street. It was destroyed by the Great Ellsworth Fire of 1933.
In 1888, electricity was introduced into the Ellsworth area.
The disputed city elections in 1896 resulted in the appointment of two separate Ellsworth police forces, each of which threatened to arrest the other.
Work on the Ellsworth hydro-electric dam began in 1907, at the site of one of the original Benjamin Milliken Union River dams. This led to the creation of the present Leonard's Lake just north of the city.
Ellsworth's first disaster of the 20th century was the Great Flood of 1923. A spring freshet rushed over the dam and carried off the metal Union River Bridge, along with many buildings along the river, such as the Dirigo Theater, the Foundry and many wharves and warehouses. This event marked the end of Ellsworth's prominence as a shipping center. The present concrete bridge was finished in 1924.
The Great Fire of 1933 destroyed most of Ellsworth's downtown commercial district, on the east side of the Union River. New buildings were built in brick, mainly in Art Deco style. The unique Ellsworth City Hall dates from this period. Many old houses outside the business district survived the conflagration.
The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of an Ellsworth business district on High Street, which is the direct route to and from Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. This area is now the largest shopping district in Hancock County, with several shopping centers and many large stores, stretching nearly to the Ellsworth-Trenton boundary.

The Model 3107 chair is a chair designed by Arne Jacobsen in 1955. It is a variation on the Ant Chair, also designed by Arne Jacobsen. Over five million units have been produced exclusively by Fritz Hansen.


== Description ==
The chair, along with the Jacobsen's Ant chair, was, according to Jacobsen, inspired by a chair made by the husband and wife design team of Charles and Ray Eames using their plywood bending techniques.The chair is available with a number of different undercarriages—as a regular four-legged chair, an office chair with five wheels and as a bar stool. It can come equipped with armrests, a writing-table attachment, and different forms of upholstering.
The chair is widely believed to have been used in Lewis Morley's iconic 1963 photograph of Christine Keeler; however, the chair used in this photograph was an imitation and not an original Jacobsen model. The Keeler chair had a hand hold cut in the back. After the publishing of the pictures, sales of the chair rose dramatically.

Hiralal Thakur (14 March 1909/1910 – 27 June 1981), known mononymously as Hiralal, was an Indian actor known for his work in Hindi films. Known for his performances as a character actor, he was called the 'bad man of the Indian screen' for his portrayal of roles with negative shades. He made his debut with the silent film Safdar Jung (1930).Hiralal also took part in India's independence movement and became an activist with the Indian National Congress when he was 14. He was later associated with the group of political and social workers that included Lala Lajpat Rai and Bhagat Singh, before moving into a career in films in 1928. After a distinguished career in films for over fifty years which included at least 150 films, he died penniless in 1981.


== Career ==
Hiralal took to acting in films "as a hobby" after being asked by filmmaker Abdur Rashid Kardar, who was making Safdar Jung in Lahore, to play the role of a Pathan. Filming of Safdar Jung had begun in 1924 and Hiralal joined in 1929. He then appeared in another silent film, Daughters of Today, which saw theatrical release first. Hiralal recalled having a "thirst for authenticity" early on in his career, citing an example of him going bald to play a "one-eyed bald-headed man" in his next film, the 1931 film Awara Raqasa ("Wandering Dancer"), also directed by Kardar. He switched to sound films, later making his debut with Pavitra Ganga (1932) in which he played a "mad monk" as one character. He appeared in dual roles in the film, both as the protagonist and antagonist, opposite Nalini Tarkhad. His performance in Din-o-Duniya (1936) as General Mohammad Tariq received praise.Hiralal then moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and became associated with the New Theatres film studio. It was here under the "able guidance" of filmmaker Hemachandra Chunder that he felt he had become "a real actor". He appeared in Mera Punjab (1940), an adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, in which he played three stages of a man's life: "the young man, the father and the grandfather". He then appeared in Sipahi (1941), playing "a soldier who fights for his country (in World War I) and then under the economic depression that follows is unable to find a job. On the verge of starvation, he becomes a gangster and at the end is shot in an encounter with his pursuers." He called the final sequence in the film in which the soldier-turned-gangster is cornered by six or seven men and is shot "the most moving scene" he had ever played. Hiralal recollected in an interview in the 1960s that it was with his role in Faisla (1947) opposite Kanan Devi that he was "able to form a certain concept of villainy which served me well later when I began to play the villain in most of my pictures." In Chunder's Teen Bhai (1955), he "played a villain" opposite Pahari Sanyal, Nazir Hussain and Bharat Bhushan's characters. Hiralal's association with the New Theatres, however, ended in 1949, when he moved to Bombay (now Mumbai).In Bombay, his first film Badal (1951), in which he played a " villainous sardar whose greed for money is his undoing", was received well. In Kishore Sahu's Sapna (1952), he played an outlaw who kidnaps the heroine played by Bina Rai. In K. Amarnath's Mehbooba (1954), he played a dacoit. In G. P. Sippy's Chandrakanta (1956), he played "a mad conqueror who wanted his people to worship him as a living God." Hiralal studied the lives of Nero and a few Egyptian Pharaohs in preparation for the role. He starred in Leader (1964) as a "fanatic killer who is out to exterminate a famous man."Hiralal rated his performance in the 1948 film Jhoothi Kasmein his best, during an interview with the Indian Express in 1965. He added that Swayamsiddha (1947) and Anjangarh (1948) were films that gave him "inspiration and strength". Hiralal credited filmmakers Birendranath Sircar and Hemachandra Chunder for having taught him to become a character actor, Roop K. Shorey for the "laugh" and "weep without sobbing" in films. He recalled Amarnath "built him up as a fighter" with his film Sarkar (1951). Hiralal was a fan of American actors John Barrymore and Paul Muni.


== Personal life ==
Hiralal was born into a Punjabi family on 14 March 1909 (or 1910) in Lahore, then a city in the Punjab Province of British India (in present-day Pakistan). He was the second of two children of Anuradha and harish, a businessman. Hiralal completed his education in Lahore and grew up watching and being influenced by the character of Ravana in the Ramlila plays.Hiralal married Darparani in 1945 and had five sons and a daughter with her. The sons were Krishna, Kamal, Prem, Ajay, and Inder, the latter of whom was an actor and model, and died in the Air India Flight 182 bombing in 1985. Apart from his mother tongue Punjabi, Hiralal could speak fluently in Hindi, Urdu and English.

The Biblioteca Guarneriana is a public library founded by the mid-15th century and located in two buildings along the Via Roma in San Daniele, Udine, region of Friuli, Italy.


== History ==
The library was initially founded by 1445 around the posthumous donation of 173 manuscripts by the vicar of Aquileia, Guarnerio d'Artegna. Some donations increased the collection over the centuries, but not until 1736 when Archbishop Giusto Fontanini endowed the library with his large collection of manuscripts and over 2000 books, did the local council decide to build a new home for the collection, including decorative shelves of oak. Presently the antique collections of the library, adjacent to the church of St Michael the Archangel, the principal church (duomo) of San Daniele, include 600 codices, 80 incunabula, and 700 books from the 16th century. A separate building, across Via Roma, holds the modern collections.

Council of Women for Home Missions was an American federated organization of women's missionary societies established in 1908. It was "one of the country's early national ecumenical agencies". While its initial focus was on home mission conferences and home mission study books, its scope increased to include work with migrant populations, Indigenous Americans, World Day of Prayer, legislative matters, and international relations.


== History ==
Composed of eleven constituent home mission boards, it was established in 1908 for the purpose of unifying home mission work and projecting a united study course. Fifty-eight member societies responded. The work was conducted through standing committees composed of members from each constituent board. The council's slogan was, "Our country, God's country". The council represented and promoted Protestant church women's home mission organizations interdenominationally. It did so through conferences, courses, institutes, and schools.Any national women's home mission board or society agreeing to cooperate in the purposes and work of the council could become a constituent member paying a nominal annual membership fee. If the annual income of the board was US$50,000 or more, it had nine representatives in the council, if the annual income was less than $50,000, it had three representatives. Some of these boards were entirely independent, while others were auxiliary to the general boards of the denominations. Some boards were composed of men and women on an equal basis. Some were for home missions only, and others combined home and foreign missions.Alice Blanchard Coleman served as president of the council from its beginning, till 1916. Mrs. John Ferguson was president in 1927.In 1940, it merged into the Home Missions Council of North America, which, in 1950, became the Division of Home Missions of the National Council of Churches.


== Schools of missions ==
Realizing the potentialities in schools of missions, it desired to serve them in every possible way. Fifteen widely situated interdenominational winter and summer schools were affiliated with the council, which. upon request, suggested leaders and teachers, and when so requested, granted a small sum for three years after affiliation for the purpose of aiding in the procuring of a teacher for the home mission study books.


== Home Missions Institute ==
At Chautauqua, New York, the Council annually conducted a Home Missions Institute along the usual lines of study hours, conferences and denominational rallies. The annual registration was well over 1,000. China, Japan, India, and Siam were represented, as well as most of the states in the U.S. The Council financed this Institute.


== Partnerships ==


=== Missionary Education Movement ===
One result of the Ecumenical Conference on Foreign Missions (1900 : New York, N.Y.) was the publishing of interdenominational study books on foreign mission topics. Immediately the need was also felt for home mission books suitable for study groups, and in 1903, there appeared the first of the home mission series, published by an interdenominational committee of women. A few years sufficed to demonstrate the desirability of a permanent and more formal organization, so in 1908, the Council of Women for Home Missions was established. The women of the various denominations had already learned how to work together on the publishing committee. For some years, the book for adults was the only one sent forth annually, but in 1911, a series for boys and girls was begun. The Young People's Missionary Movement (later renamed, the Missionary Education Movement), had meanwhile been launched and was publishing books for various ages on home and foreign mission themes. The incongruity and inefficiency of having two groups annually publishing interdenominational home mission books led to the formation, in 1918, of a Joint Committee on Home Mission Literature, composed of representatives from each of the two agencies. Neither body relinquished sovereignty or separate entity or the right to publish separately. Both enjoyed and profited by the comradeship; the constituency did not have to decide which of two books to study. A theme for yeara was chosen and books for various ages or for various types of groups were jointly published, as well as accompanying supplemental material. By the early 1920s, 100,000 or more of the books for adults were printed, and proportionately large editions of the books for children and young people. Both bodies sold at wholesale to boards and denominational agencies, the Movement to the general boards, the council to the women's boards. Retail sales were made by the boards to the constituencies.


=== Federation of Woman's Boards of Foreign Missions of North America ===
At one time, an annual "Day of Prayer for Home Missions" began to be celebrated interdenominationally, and also a "Day of Prayer for Foreign Missions". The Council prepared the program for one; the Federation of Woman's Boards of Foreign Missions of North America for the other. In 1919, the two organizations agreed to observe the same date each year the first Friday in Lent. Subsequently, a joint committee each year prepared the program and preliminary "Call to Prayer".Another joint committee with the Federation served local "women's church and missionary federations". These groups assumed widely divergent names and forms. Some were solely missionary in character. Some confined the membership to the societies of evangelical churches, but included activities not primarily missionary. Some included organizations of a civic or social character. Some cooperated closely with committees having in charge schools of missions. A few were departments of local councils of churches or church federations. Some had a wide range of activities and annually conducted institutes for missionary instruction having paid registrations of several hundreds. Others were dormant a good prat of each year, active only in connection with the observance of the Day of Prayere for Missions. There was at least one state and two county women's federations. The power latent in these local federations had never been adequately tapped. Provision had been made for affiliation of local federations with the council and with the Federation of Women's Boards of Foreign Missions, and aid was rendered to a number in advice as to speakers and leaders of study books, methods of work, and lines of suitable activity. Frequently, these federations took up a collection in connection with the observance of the Day of Prayer for Missions.


=== Home Missions Council ===
Another partner was the Home Missions Council, the similar agency for the general boards. It seemed appropriate to the two Councils to merge committees which faced similar tasks. Therefore, there were more than a dozen active joint committees covering types of work and groups of people in the U.S. and its possessions or dependencies. The membership of these committees was made up from the boards carrying on or interested in missionary work for the specific groups. Interdenominational conferences were planned, programs of activity unitedly formulated, and opportunity for interchange of information and inspiration provided. Through the instrumentality of one committee, various men's and women's boards furnished a religious work director to several government Indian schools. A subcommittee on Farm and Cannery Migrants was composed of a representative appointed by each of the women's boards financially cooperating in the definite work for migrant fruit and vegetable harvesters and cannery workers. A specially designated Secretary of Recruiting served the two Councils, arranging for the presentation of home missions at the summer conferences, striving to help coordinate the recruiting work of the various denominations and agencies, and to correlate and promoted the organization of home service groups.


=== Consulting boards ===
Organizations in full accord and sympathy with the aims and methods of the council, but which because of their constitutions and methods of work do not fall into the class eligible for constituency, became consulting organizations and representatives served on committees of the council. The National Board of the Y.W.C.A. and the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union were consulting boards.

Born to a German mother and an Italian father, she was taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, the Royal Academy of Music and the Mozarteum University Salzburg. Comberti was involved in early music and played for The English Concert, St. James' Baroque, Ex Cathedra and the Collegium Musicum 90. She also taught at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music. An award and position at the Royal Academy of Music are named after the violinist.


== Biography ==
Comberti was born to a German mother and an Italian father in London on 28 September 1952. She was known by the name Mica from an early age. Comberti demonstrated a talent for music from an early age; aged 19 she travelled to Vienna to study with the violinist Eduard Melkus at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna with her experiences directing her to historical performances. In 1970 Comberti performed with the jazz band Centipede run by the pianist Keith Tippett.She returned to the United Kingdom in 1972. Comberti spent the following three years under the tutelage of Manoug Parikian at the Royal Academy of Music, London. She subsequently went back to Vienna for two years and underwent further education at the Mozarteum University Salzburg as a pupil of Sándor Végh, whom had a profound influence on her life. Comberti had her interest in historical performance strengthened by attending the classes of Nikolaus Harnoncourt. She returned to the United Kingdom for a second time in 1977 to become involved in early music. Comberti played for a number of ensembles, record the scores of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn with the Salomon Quartet from 1982 on and was principal player of The English Concert until 1990.Comberti left The English Concert in 1990 and began to lead orchestras for the St. James' Baroque, and Ex Cathedra from 1987, and was a guest of other established groups. She played as a soloist with the Collegium Musicum 90 and recorded the Concerto for Two Violins for them. Comberti recorded the sonatas of Johann Sebastian Bach with the harpsichordist and long-time musical partner Colin Tilney. She taught at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and then at the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music. Comberti was also associated with the Dartington Summer School and Festival.From 1999 on she trained the Bavarian State Opera in period style for several of its productions of Claudio Monteverdi and George Frideric Handel and enhanced the reputation of the opera for its performances of the latter composer within Germany. Comberti undertook a similar venture with the Hamburg State Opera in 2002. Her final public performance was with the violinist Simon Standage in February 2003.


== Personal life ==
She was married to the violinist Gustav Clarkson, and had three children with him (two sons and a daughter). Comberti became ill while holidaying in August 2002 and was diagnosed with cancer. She followed a strict diet to lessen the effects of cancer and continued to teach through her illness. She died on 4 March 2003.


== Legacy ==
Standage in his obituary of Comberti in The Guardian said Comberti was "at the forefront of an influential generation of British early musicians. As a zestful performer with an inquiring spirit and, more recently, as a thoughtful and dedicated teacher, she earned the affection and respect of colleagues and pupils alike." A performance of Bach's St John Passion by Ex Cathedra at Lichfield Cathedral on 3 April 2003 was dedicated to her memory.The Micaela Comberti Chair for Baroque Violin at the Royal Academy of Music was established in September 2008 and is currently led by one of Comberti's pupils, Rachel Podger. The conservatoire also awards the Mica Comberti Prize on a yearly basis "for the performance of any complete work by JS Bach for violin, viola or viola da gamba."

German submarine U-93 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down on 9 September 1939 at the F. Krupp Germaniawerft in Kiel as yard number 598, launched on 8 June 1940 and commissioned on 30 July 1940 under Kapitänleutnant Claus Korth.
She sank eight ships of 43,392 gross register tons (GRT) in seven patrols but was herself sunk by a British destroyer on 15 January 1942.


== Design ==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-93 had a displacement of 769 tonnes (757 long tons) when at the surface and 871 tonnes (857 long tons) while submerged. She had a total length of 67.10 m (220 ft 2 in), a pressure hull length of 50.50 m (165 ft 8 in), a beam of 6.20 m (20 ft 4 in), a height of 9.60 m (31 ft 6 in), and a draught of 4.74 m (15 ft 7 in). The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of 2,800 to 3,200 metric horsepower (2,060 to 2,350 kW; 2,760 to 3,160 shp) for use while surfaced, two AEG GU 460/8–27 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 750 metric horsepower (550 kW; 740 shp) for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two 1.23 m (4 ft) propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres (750 ft).The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 17.7 knots (32.8 km/h; 20.4 mph) and a maximum submerged speed of 7.6 knots (14.1 km/h; 8.7 mph). When submerged, the boat could operate for 80 nautical miles (150 km; 92 mi) at 4 knots (7.4 km/h; 4.6 mph); when surfaced, she could travel 8,500 nautical miles (15,700 km; 9,800 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). U-93 was fitted with five 53.3 cm (21 in) torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one 8.8 cm (3.46 in) SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a 2 cm (0.79 in) C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.


== Service history ==
The boat's first patrol was preceded by a trip from Kiel to Kristiansand in Norway.


=== First patrol ===
She left the Norwegian port on 9 September 1940, heading for St. Nazaire in France which she reached, via the North Sea and the gap between the Faroe and Shetland Islands, on 25 October.
On the way, she sank the Hurunui on the 15th, 120 nautical miles (220 km; 140 mi) west of the Butt of Lewis, (the most northerly point of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides). Two crew members died, but there were 73 survivors. She was also attacked three times in one day (17 October), twice by ships and once by an aircraft; no damage was caused. She sank the Dokka south of Iceland on the 17th: The survivors were then questioned by the Germans (a fairly common practice). They said that the sunken ship was the Cukna, but Korth saw through this ruse de guerre. U-93 was forced to dive by the presence and gunfire of HMS Folkestone.
After that, the boat headed for mid-ocean before docking at her French Atlantic base.


=== Second, third and fourth patrols ===
U-93's second voyage was uneventful, but during her third sortie she sank the Dione II with gunfire, northwest of Northern Ireland. She was also attacked by an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley of No. 502 Squadron RAF. The damage was such that the boat required repairs lasting three months.
The submarine's fourth patrol, which commenced on 12 July 1941, was disrupted when three men were wounded in an accident involving a machine gun. Nevertheless, she sank the Elusa on 21 May south southeast of Cape Farewell (Greenland).


=== Fifth and sixth patrols ===
Her fifth patrol took her as far south as a point west of Western Sahara. She was unsuccessfully bombed on the return journey west of Cape St. Vincent in Portugal
The boat's sixth patrol was to an area east of Newfoundland and Labrador on the Canadian side of the Atlantic.


=== Fate ===
Her seventh and final sortie began with her departure from St. Nazaire on 23 December 1941. She was sunk by depth charges dropped by HMS Hesperus between Portugal and the Azores on 15 January 1942.


=== Wolfpacks ===
U-93 took part in five wolfpacks, namely:

West (8 – 26 May 1941)
Süd (22 July – 5 August 1941)
Schlagetot (23 October – 1 November 1941)
Raubritter (1 – 8 November 1941)
Seydlitz (27 December 1941 – 15 January 1942)

Deconstruction  (or deconstructivism) is a fashion phenomenon of the 1980s and 1990s. It involves the use of costume forms that are based on identifying the structure of clothing - they are used as an external element of the costume. This phenomenon is associated with designers Martin Margiela, Yohji Yamamoto, Rei Kawakubo, Karl Lagerfeld, Ann Demeulemeester and Dries van Noten. Deconstructivism in fashion is considered as part of a philosophical system formed under the influence of the works of Jacques Derrida.


== Term ==
In fashion, the term "deconstructivism" emerged in the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s. The principles of this direction were outlined in 1985 in Harold Code's article "Rei Kawakubo and the Aesthetics of Poverty". In the early 1990s, Harold Koda and Richard Martin introduced the concept of fashion deconstruction in the Infra-Apparel exhibition catalog, where "deconstructivism" was described as a unified trend of the 1990s. It is believed that the term "deconstructivism" in relation to fashion began to be used after an architectural exhibition in 1988 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The work that summarized the basic principles of deconstructivism in the 1990s can be considered the text by Alison Gill "Deconstruction Fashion: The Making of Unfinished, Decomposing and Re-Assembled Clothes". Gill defined deconstruction in fashion as a term to describe "garments on a runway that are unfinished, coming apart, recycled, transparent or grunge".


== General principles ==


=== Origin ===
Deconstructivism is considered one of the most influential fashion trends of the 1980s and 1990s. It arose as a reaction to continental philosophy and can be seen as one of the attempts to present fashion as an intellectual movement. Designers and critics have emphasized the alternative nature of fashion deconstruction to commercial or runway fashion, although this opposition is rather relative. Deconstructivism was focused not so much on the mechanism and rules of the fashion industry, but on philosophy and architecture.


=== Basic elements ===
Deconstructivism is associated with the emergence of a new cutting technique that emphasized the structural elements of the costume. At the same time, deconstruction is considered a protest against the style of the 1980s. It is assessed as an attempt to create a new direction in costume both in terms of shaping and in the sense of creating a new fashion ideology. Deconstructivism involves identifying elements of cut in the external appearance of a suit.


=== Designers ===
There are different points of view as to which designers should be considered representatives of deconstruction in fashion. The list of main participants is ambiguous. In some cases, it is limited to representatives of the "Antwerp Six", with special emphasis on such names as Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester.


=== Deconstructivism and the concept of intellectual fashion ===
The idea of resistance, embedded within the framework of deconstruction, implied the desire to see fashion as an intellectual sphere. The structure of the costume was represented by the intellectual side of the clothing. Under the influence of deconstruction, a new strategy was formed in fashion - an understanding of fashion as an intellectual phenomenon.


== Deconstruction in fashion and architecture ==
The emergence of deconstructivism in fashion is associated with the architectural tradition. The starting point is considered to be the exhibition "Deconstructivist Architecture", which took place at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1988. The exhibition presented works by then little-known artists Rem Koolhaas, Zaha Hadid, Frank Gehry, Peter Eisenman, Daniel Libeskind and Bernard Tschumi.


== Deconstructivism in fashion and philosophy ==
Deconstructivism in fashion is usually correlated with deconstruction as a philosophical movement - primarily with the works of Jacques Derrida. Fashionable deconstructivism is presented as a rethinking of the philosophical method formed by representatives of the European and Yale schools. Fashion deconstruction also implies that the fashion system in general, and costume in particular, is erroneously thought of as a structure. Deconstruction in fashion was part of a philosophical movement where the ideas of deconstruction could be expressed in applied forms. For fashion, turning to the philosophy of deconstruction was one of the ways to confirm its intellectual status.


== Deconstruction and the idea of disorder ==
Deconstructivism in fashion was not a protest against the idea of order as such. It developed as resistance to a certain type of order: deconstructivism assumed the possibility of decentralization of the system (including the fashion system) and the possibility of verifying externally established rules. In fashionable deconstruction, the disorderly was part of an established system. Fashionable deconstruction positioned clutter as a structural element.


== Deconstruction and anti-fashion ==
 
Deconstructivism in costume has become one of the consistent trends built on opposition to the idea of fashion. It became a form of criticism of standard commercial clothing and implied the possibility of a system focused on a philosophical prototype. Deconstructivism suggested the possibility of a new social reference point for fashion. In addition, deconstructivism was one of the first large-scale movements that outlined the very possibility of alternative fashion.

== Chip and Pepper's Cartoon Madness ==
At a peak in their popularity, the Foster brothers appeared on a Canadian TV station singing "Chip and Pepper: get hip or get out!" The footage came into the hands of NBC's head of entertainment, Brandon Tartikoff, who decided to give them a Saturday morning cartoon show. In fall 1991, Chip and Pepper's Cartoon Madness debuted. The new edition to NBC's animated line-up included sketches and interviews, but old cartoons such as Casper and Captain Caveman took up most of the airtime. The show lasted one season before NBC dropped its animated block altogether in 1992.


== Apparel line ==
Chip & Pepper California is a clothing company which specializes in denim and sportswear that was launched in 1987. In 2003, it entered the premium denim market. It is sold in over 42 countries. The tie-dye fashions were popular in Canada in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The Battle of the Kalâa of the Beni Abbes took place during the winter of 1553 between the regency of Algiers and the Kingdom of Beni Abbas.
In order to counterbalance the influence of Sultan Abdelaziz of the Kalaa, Salah Rais ordered an expedition against the Kalaa of the Beni Abbes to annihilate his influence. The army of the Regency camped at Bona, a league from the Kalaa. Abdelaziz made a sortie against them and defeated them after a clash which was deadly for both sides. The armies of the Regency were forced to retreat after heavy losses, and this battle diminished their reputation. The victory allowed Sultan Abdelaziz to confirm his control over the Bibans and the Hodna. The following year the Regency of Algiers directed another expedition against Abdelaziz in the Battle of Oued-el-Lhâm.

Waterton Lake is a mountain lake in southern Alberta, Canada and northern Montana, United States. The lake is composed of two bodies of water, connected by a shallow channel known locally as the Bosporus. The two parts are referred to as Middle Waterton Lake, and Upper Waterton Lake, the latter of which is divided by the Canada–United States border with Canada containing about two thirds of the lake while the Southern third falls in the United States. The Boundary Commission Trail ends at the lake as the last border marker was placed there on 8 August 1874. The United States Geological Survey gives the geocoordinates of 49°03′00″N 113°54′03″W for Upper Waterton Lake. Lower Waterton Lake is north of Middle Waterton Lake and is separated by a channel known as the Dardanelles.The northern, lower end of the main lake lies in Waterton Lakes National Park while the upper, southern part of the lake is located in Glacier National Park. In 1979, UNESCO established the Waterton Biosphere Reserve to protect the diverse habitats including prairie grasslands, aspen parkland, subalpine forests, alpine tundra and freshwater fens that surround the lake.Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park was created by the US and Canada in 1932, and in 1976 it was designated an International Biosphere Reserve.  Later, in 1995, it was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.The upper and middle Waterton Lake system has a surface of 10.1 km2 (3.9 sq mi), while the lower lake, which is in Canada only, has 1.5 km2 (0.58 sq mi) and lies at an altitude of 1,274 m (4,180 ft).  Two soundings of the lake were 210 feet (64 m) and 317 feet (97 m), done in 1910. More recent soundings have revealed a depth of 490 ft (150 m).Highway 5 has its westernmost point on the shores of the lake.

Waterton River flows north from the Lower Waterton Lake for approx. 32 km to reach the Waterton Reservoir (Est. 1964) by the village of Hill Spring.
The Waterton Reservoir diverts water of about 20 m3/s to the Belly River just upstream from the Belly's own diversion weir which diverts water to the St. Mary River. The Waterton continues north from the reservoir for approx. 39 km until it reaches the confluence with the Belly River, which is a tributary of the Oldman River.
Waterton River has relatively reduced sediment concentrations due to the lakes and the reservoir acting as a sediment-settling trap.
The total length of the river is 80 km (50 mi).
Waterton River's mean peak discharge averages about 80 m3/s.
Tributaries to the Waterton River include:

Foothill Creek
Drywood CreekYarrow CreekDungarvan Creek
Galwey BrookCottonwood CreekCrooked CreekWaterton Reservoir has a Full Supply Level (FSL) of 1,185.67 metres, and an Irrigation Capacity of 114,334 dam3.

"Headlights" is a song by American rapper Eminem, featuring American singer Nate Ruess of the band Fun. It was written by Eminem, Emile Haynie, Jeff Bhasker, Luis Riesto, and Ruess, while being produced by the former three. In the song, Eminem apologizes to his mother, Debbie Mathers, for criticizing her in his earlier songs and for showing scorn and resentment towards her in the past. It was released on February 5, 2014, as the album's fifth and the final single. It peaked at number 45 on the  Billboard Hot 100.


== Background and composition ==

Eminem had a difficult relationship with his mother since childhood. In his music, Eminem dissed her on various songs, including his breakthrough hit, "My Name Is", "Role Model", "Kill You", "My Mom", "Without Me", "Marshall Mathers", "Criminal", and most notably "Cleanin' Out My Closet." "Headlights" is an apology to his mother for the years of insults and "his plea for a united (or at least less dysfunctional) family." The title "Headlights" is a reference to their last meeting. As she drove away, he became fixated on the headlights of her car as he coped with feelings of "overwhelming sadness." He admits to his recklessness with lyrics directed towards his mom in the very first line, not really knowing his words would hurt her that much. In the song, Eminem references a few incidences from their rocky relationship, getting kicked out of the house on Christmas Eve, constant fighting, and his younger brother Nathan's removal to foster care. He also expresses regret that he has never let his mother be involved in his children's lives. In the song he acknowledges that his mother wrongfully endured the brunt of the blame for his tough upbringing and even gives her credit for her efforts to raise him as a single parent. Eminem admits that he remains estranged from his mother to this day. He also states that he cringes when he hears "Cleanin' Out My Closet" on the radio and he no longer performs it at shows.
In an interview with Sway Calloway, Eminem stated that, "everything he wanted to address" in regard to his mother is on "Headlights" and he likely will not speak on the topic outside of that particular song. He also told Zane Lowe that; "It was one of those things that’s bothered me for a little bit. It was one of those things that I needed to get off my chest. So I don’t really have anything to elaborate or expand on that record other than everything that I needed to say, I put on that record."


== Recording ==
"Headlights" was produced by Emile and Jeff Bhasker, with additional production by Eminem and additional keyboards by Luis Resto. The song was written by Eminem, Nate Ruess, Emile Haynie, Jeff Bhasker, and Luis Resto. Recording for the song was done at Effigy Studios in Ferndale, Michigan by Mike Strange, Joe Strange and Tony Campana. The song's intro, bridge, and refrain is sung by Fun.'s lead singer Nate Ruess.


== Critical reception ==
"Headlights" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Julie Leconte of Now said: "The track's genius partially lies in the anticipatory tension it creates in the listener. Em loves to set us up with faux sentimentality, then laugh when we’re duped. But on 'Headlights' the shoe never drops, leaving us with really sad insight into their non-relationship." Colin McGuire of PopMatters said that the song "gives us quite possibly the most touching moment Em has ever put on wax".DJ Booth stated that "even though the hook on 'Headlights', by Fun's Nate Ruess, is light and airy exactly where it should have been deep, the raw and crushingly emotional lyrics from Eminem, especially ones that put an end to his running feud with his mother, are more than powerful enough to make 'Headlights' remarkable". Andy Gill of The Independent also praised the track, calling it "an almost shockingly apologetic love-letter to the mother he once denigrated so viciously". Edna Gundersen of USA Today stated that "it's an admirable confession" but "a so-so track".


== Music video ==
The music video was filmed in Detroit, Michigan on April 5, 2014, and directed by Academy Award winning film director Spike Lee. It was released on May 11, 2014, Mother's Day in the United States. The video takes a non-chronological look at the turbulent relationship from his mother's first-person perspective. This music video, running at 4 minutes and 10 seconds, uses the shortened version, in which Ruess' first chorus before Eminem's first verse, and the bridge (containing the lines from both Eminem and Ruess) before the end of its album version, are omitted.

Malaysian legal history has been determined by events spanning a period of some six hundred years. Of these, three major periods were largely responsible for shaping the current Malaysian system. The first was the founding of the Melaka Sultanate at the beginning of the 15th century; second was the spread of Islam in the indigenous culture; and finally, and perhaps the most significant in modern Malaysia, was British colonial rule which brought with it constitutional government and the common law system.


== Sultanate of Melaka ==
During the realm of the Sultanate, Melaka was an important trading port and the maintenance of law and order was crucial to its prosperity. The administration of justice was placed under the direct charge of the Bendahara (or chief minister) who exercised both political and judicial functions. The Temenggung (which is the commander of troops and police) was responsible for apprehending criminals, maintaining prisons and generally keeping the peace. The welfare of foreigners residing in the state was looked after by several Shahbandars (harbour masters and collectors of customs).
Little is known of the legal system in those days but it is generally accepted that the law administered then was a combination of Muslim law and the "Adat Temenggung" (patriarchal Malay customary law). The "Adat Temengung" was the law of the Sultan or the law ordained by the rulers and later adopted in the other regions of Peninsular Malaysia. It was the basis of the law as found in Malay legal digests compiled between the 15th and 19th centuries.
The formal legal text of traditional Melaka consisted of the Undang-Undang Melaka (Laws of Melaka), variously called the Hukum Kanun Melaka and Risalat Hukum Kanun, and the Undang-Undang Laut Melaka (the Maritime Laws of Melaka). The laws as written in the legal digests went through an evolutionary process. The legal rules that eventually evolved were shaped by three main influences, namely the early non-indigenous Hindu/Buddhist tradition, Islam and the indigenous "adat".


== European and British influence ==
When Melaka fell into the hands of the Portuguese from 1511 to 1641 and the Dutch from 1641 till 1786, the local people continued to practise Islamic laws and Malay customs. It could be said that the Portuguese and the Dutch laws made relatively little impact on the legal system as a whole other than the political and administrative structures.
In 1786, Britain acquired the island of Penang, the first territory in Malaysia to fall into British hands. The main preoccupation of the British administrators during the first decades after the founding of Penang, was the maintenance of some form of order and to this end, local customs and law were allowed to continue but tempered by such portions of the English law as were considered just and expedient. Some judgements meted out may seem rather strange by today's standard but it should be borne in mind that they merely reflected the harsh and often chaotic conditions of those pioneering days. Complaints and petitions were made over many years for a better system of administering justice. Finally, it came in the form of the Royal Charter of Justice of 1807. The Charter is the most significant event in Malaysian legal history as it marked the beginning of the statutory introduction of English law into this country. The Charter established the Court of Judicature of the Prince of Wales' island (as Penang was then known) to exercise jurisdiction in all civil, criminal and ecclesiastical matters. It was interpreted by the courts as introducing to Penang the law of England as it stood in 1807 insofar as it was suitable to local conditions and circumstances.
When Penang, Singapore, which was founded by the British in 1819 along with Melaka, which fell to the British as a trade-off under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, formed the Straits Settlement in 1826, a new charter, the Charter of Justice was introduced. A new court called 'The Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Melaka" was created by this Charter. Penang in a sense had a second statutory reception of English law although it was the first for Singapore and Melaka. In one stroke of the pen, the Straits Settlements received a large dose of English law.
Despite the new Charter, the administration of justice was far from satisfactory. A third Charter of Justice was granted in 1855 which enabled the reorganisation of the court system. In 1867, when the administration of the Straits Settlements from India was transferred to the Colonial Office, the court system was reorganised once again. By Ordinance 5 of 1868, the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Melaka was abolished. A new court known as the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was established. In 1873, the Supreme Court was further reorganised under four judges – the Chief Justice, the Justice of Penang, the Senior Puisne Judge and the Junior Puisne Judge. The Court of Quarter Sessions was established as a criminal court and presided over by the Senior and Junior Puisne Judges in Singapore and Penang respectively. A Court of Appeal was also constituted. By then, the judiciary had slowly evolved into its modern form.
Few of the British Indian statutes were imported in the Federated Malay States through the British Residents, including the Penal Code, the Contract Ordinance, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Civil Procedure Code.: 222 English commercial law was formally introduced into the Straits Settlements by Section 6 of the Civil Law Ordinance, 1878. This provision, as re-enacted in the Civil Law Act, 1956 (Revised 1972), is still applicable in Penang and Melaka.
English land law was specifically excluded by sub-section 2. The whole section of this Ordinance was incorporated into the Civil Law Ordinance of 1909 and later re-enacted as Section 5 of the Civil Law Ordinance (Chap. 42 of the 1936 Revised Edition). This was the legal situation in the Straits Settlements until its dissolution in 1946 following the formation of the Malayan Union.
The statutory introduction of English law to the Federated Malay States comprising the states of Perak, Selangor, Pahang and Negeri Sembilan occurred in 1937 with the introduction of the Civil Law Enactment, 1937. The Unfederated Malay States, consisting the states of Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu and Johor, became part of the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Civil Law (Extension) Ordinance, 1951, extended the application of the Enactment to these states.
Law of Sarawak Ordinance 1928 established as statutory authority for introduction of English law into Sarawak, later substituted with the Application of Laws Ordinance 1949 for broader application. Civil Law Ordinance 1938 established as statutory authority for introduction of English law into North Borneo, later substituted with the Application of Laws Ordinance 1951 for broader application.: 66–67, 161 Both enactments were replaced by the Civil Law Ordinance, 1956, which applied to all eleven states of the Federation. When Malaysia was established in 1963, it became necessary to harmonise the law to take effect in Sabah and Sarawak. The 1956 Ordinance was then superseded by the Civil Law Act, 1956 (revised 1972) which came into force on 1 April 1972.

Nosaltres Sols! (English: Ourselves only!) was a Catalan nationalist paramilitary political movement from the 20th century. It was born in 1931, in a rented space property of the political party Unió Catalanista (Catalan Unity) and created a weekly journal with the exact same name as well . The purpose of the organization was to confront those who were considered enemies of Catalonia, mainly Spanish unionists, but also anarchists, communists and fascists.
Its founder and main leader was Daniel Cardona i Civit known as Vibrant and L'irlandès (the Irishman) and elected Mayor of his hometown Sant Just Desvern. Nosaltres Sols! can be understood as a continuation or political realisation of Bandera Negra i Santa Germandat Catalana (Black Flag and Holly Catalan Brotherhood) founded in 1925, an armed branch of the independentist political party Estat Català whose members carried out a terrorist bomb attack against king Alfonso XIII of Spain and dictator Primo de Rivera in the town of Garraf and among other action, another bomb attack against the earl of Maldá, a unionist noble in favour of the Spanish monarchy.Its name comes from the translation into Catalan of the main slogan of the Irish republican party Sinn Féin Sinn Féin Amháin ("ourselves only"), which was to influence the ideology of Daniel Cardona i Civit and the organisation as a whole. Even though Cardona, because of his many travels to Ireland was only inspired by the Irish Fight for independence, as he himself wrote in many occasions, it has been pointed out by the Spanish historian Xosé Manoel Núñez Seixas, that a member of the organization, representing its germanophile side, Manel Blasi, contacted German National Socialists, who ensured that the Catalan northern 'race' 'was more aryan than the 'africanized' Spanish 'race' . Also another member, Baldomer Palazon, representing its Italophile side made contact with Italian fascists. Truth is that in the end, Nosaltres Sols! fought against both German and Italian forces who physically supported the Nationalist forces during the  Spanish Civil War.Many militants came from Estat Català who criticized the decision of  Francesc Macià of giving birth to a new political party called Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia), other militants came from Palestra, a Catalan youth nationalist hiking organization influenced by the Czech Sokol, the Irish Fianna Éirann, and Robert Baden-Powell scouting.
 Nosaltres Sols! was transformed into l'Organització Militar Nosaltres Sols!' or OMNS (the Militar organization Nosaltres Sols!) when the statue of autonomy of Núria was proclaimed during the second Spanish Republic since they considered it to be very soft and useless regarding sovereignty.Nosaltres Sols! Instigated and actively participated in the Events of 6 October, a separatist attempt to raise in arms, instigated by the government of Catalonia and its President Lluís Companys in order to secede from Spain, for which Daniel Cardona i Civit was to be condemned to death by firing squad and therefore exiled. In Perpignan, Cardona made contact with members of the Basque independentist forces, and the Basque Nationalist Party.In June 1936, after the coup d'état, Nosaltres Sols! maintained its loyalty to Republican Catalonia and therefore fought alongside the republican army, inside the Estat Català branch and the Generalitat forces with certain autonomy. And after the Spanish Civil War was over, most of the militants, still very young founded the Front Nacional de Catalunya (National Front of Catalonia) and the Organització de Resistència nacional (organization of the national resistance), which fought the Wehrmacht in France and afterwards kept on fighting against Francoist Spain, mainly through Guerrilla warfare in the Pyrenees alongside other partisans.

The Muskegon River ( mə-SKEE-gən) is a 216-mile-long (348 km) river in the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. From its source at Houghton Lake in Roscommon County, the river flows in a generally southwesterly direction to its mouth at Lake Michigan at the eponymous city of Muskegon. The river drains an area of 2,350 square miles (6,100 km2), and collects a number of tributaries, including the Little Muskegon River, Hersey River, and Clam River.
In September 2002, an article in National Geographic raised concerns about a controversial deal made with Nestlé Waters North America, giving them permission "to bottle up to 210 million gallons (about 800 million liters) a year from an aquifer north of Grand Rapids, Michigan that recharges the Muskegon River".


== Description of the watershed ==
The Muskegon River watershed drains 2,350 square miles (6,100 km2) from ten counties in north central Michigan: Muskegon, Newaygo, Mecosta, Clare, Osceola, and Roscommon.  The watershed flows through the cities of  Muskegon, Newaygo, Big Rapids, Evart, and Houghton Lake.  The river follows a southwesterly route through north central Michigan from its headwaters at Houghton Lake to its mouth at Muskegon Lake, which ultimately empties into Lake Michigan.
There are three man-made reservoirs on the Muskegon River, the Rogers Dam Pond, Hardy Dam Pond, and the Croton Dam Pond.  All three dams on the river are owned and operated by Consumers Power for power generation purposes.  Rogers Dam is located in Mecosta County south of Big Rapids, with Hardy Dam and Croton Dam located in Newaygo County.


== History ==
Like many of its neighboring streams, the Muskegon was one of the favored logging rivers during the boom years of the 1880s-1890s. Remnants of stray logs embedded on the river bottom, left over from the spring logging runs, can still be seen along the river. The river is significant to the Algonquian peoples for fishing and hunting.
Winfield Scott Gerrish established a seven-mile-long logging railroad from Lake George to the Muskegon River. However, there were several Michigan logging railroads in operation in the 1850s, including the seven-mile-long Blendon Lumber Company railroad in Ottawa County, which was the first in the state to employ a steam locomotive in May 1857.


== Wildlife ==
There is abundant wildlife, including black bear, otters, waterfowl, white-tailed deer, and bald eagles and, despite increasing development, some areas are still fairly remote and natural with much of the surrounding land composed of state-owned tracts.
The Muskegon State Game Area is an 8,411 acre section of land which overlays the Muskegon River on the section between Maple Island Road and US Route 31. This state game area is accessible for licensed hunters. Permits can be obtained for whitetail deer hunting and waterfowl hunting. The Muskegon State Game Area spans both Muskegon County and Newaygo County.


== Recreation ==
The river is popular for recreational fishing for large migratory steelhead, brown trout and planted Chinook Salmon.
Due to its slow speed and length (being shorter only then the Grand River), the river is popular for Kayaking and Canoeing.Camping is another popular activity around the river, with several shoreline parks and campgrounds.
Hunting is popular in the forests near by on public hunting land.


== Crossings ==

There are approximately 31 bridge crossings over the Muskegon River waterway.  These bridge crossing include motorized vehicle crossings, railroads, and several pedestrian/bicycle trail crossings.  The majority of the bicycle and pedestrian trail crossings are former railroad bridges which have been converted to non-motorized traffic.


== Dams ==
The three major dams of the Muskegon River (Rogers, Hardy and Croton) generate about 45,600 kilowatts, with about 30,000 of that from Hardy Dam.  This provides enough electricity to serve a community of nearly 23,000.  The smaller Reedsburg Dam is near the source of the Muskegon River.

The Eriphyle ringlet (Erebia eriphyle) is a member of the subfamily Satyrinae of family Nymphalidae. It is a high mountain butterfly found in the Alps.Wheeler (1903) gives a short description


== Description in Seitz ==
E. eriphyle Frr. (36 c). This Erebia which is very close to melampus was formerly considered to be only a variety of the latter, but is constantly different. The distal band of the forewing is more or less reddish brown, sometimes brown-yellow, being separated by the veins into several elongate, distally rounded spots. The number of these spots is variable, there being usually 5, sometimes only 3-4. The 2 spots placed close to the outer margin bear small black dots. On the hindwing there are 3 - 4 red-brown or brownish spots of which the one near the median vein in cellule 4 is placed a little more basad, being always larger and more elongate, while in melampusi it is never larger than the other spots of the hindwing. The shape and position of this spot and the absence of black centres are the main characters of eriphyle, which moreover is distinctly larger than melampus. Beneath the band of the forewing is lighter than above, being ochre-yellow in many specimens ; the spots of the hindwing are of the same colour, being much more prominent than above. In the female the ground-colour paler, the underside yellowish brown, band and spots less distinct than in the male. The distal margin of the male somewhat paler than the ground, brownish grey in the female. Antenna black-brown above, white-grey beneath. — An inhabitant of the Alps, prefers limestone, and occurs in July and August at altitudes of from 900 to 2200 m. — ab. impunctata Hofn. differs in the spots of both wings being larger and in the band of the forewing bearing no black dots. — In ab. tristis H.Schiff., from Graubunden and the Alps of Schwyz, the marginal band of the forewing is brighter in colour and the disc of the hindwing beneath has a reddish flush. — ab. intermedia Frey, from Carinthia, has more distinct reddish yellow spots, also on the hindwing.

New Dundee is a small community of 1,119 people at the time of the 2016 Census, in the township of Wilmot, Ontario, Canada. It is located southwest of Kitchener.


== History ==

The land grants to New Dundee's early settlers were largely in Concessions 2 and 3, Block A, Wilmot Township. The township was opened to settlement in 1824 and was not part of the German Company Tract purchased out of Haldimand Tract land, but lay to the west of it. Wilmot was divided into three blocks arranged latitudinally: Block A in the south, Block B in the north, and the German Block in the centre. While the German Block was largely settled by Germans, Blocks A and B were acquired by the Canada Land Company, and were settled by a mix of German, Irish, Scottish, and English people, along with others. One of the Company's goals was to promote English, Scottish, and Irish settlement in the township; however, only a small number of these peoples ever did settle in the area, and they were largely concentrated within Block A. While the German Block was connected to Waterloo Township by three major thoroughfares (Erb's Road, Snyder's Road, and Bleam's Road), each leading to an established mill, Block A only had one: the Huron Road, which unlike the others, was a long-distance route connecting as far west as Goderich and as far east as Guelph. It became the dominant roadway in the Waterloo County area until the arrival of the railways in the 1850s lessened its importance, and was a major transportation corridor within Upper Canada as a whole for many years.New Dundee itself was founded by the Millar pioneer family. The Millars emigrated from Scotland around 1825, and originally settled in the Niagara area. Arriving in Waterloo Township, several of them at first moved to the Sand Hills area which would later become Berlin and finally, Kitchener, where they established the first general store in that community. John Millar was the first member of the family to settle in the New Dundee area; in 1826 he dammed Alder Creek and built the first sawmill and general store there. John named the community New Dundee after his home town of Dundee, Scotland. The settlement was located off the Huron Road, at the far southeast corner of Block A, requiring settlers to construct a connecting road in order to access the outside world conveniently.Frederick Gourlay Millar later bought John's sawmill, house, and store, and also constructed a gristmill. The Millars were soon joined by other pioneer families: the Reichard family in 1829, who opened their own sawmill on the creek on land granted to them in lieu of payment for their work on the Huron Road, and the Bettschen family, who cleared the dense forest on the southern half of Lot 5, Concession 3 and built a farm and blacksmith shop. Another early settler was a squatter, Dan Schafer, who lived alone in a trapper's cabin on the northern half of Lot 5, Concession 3. Frederick Millar, who was civic-minded and had played a role in the early growth of Berlin, had a village plan drawn up in the 1850s. The planned-for village never truly materialized as shortly after, New Dundee, already located a distance from the Huron Road, was bypassed by the Grand Trunk Railway, which passed through the German Block communities of Petersburg, Baden, and New Hamburg instead.The Post Office was opened in 1852. By 1870, there were two churches, two hotels, a school, the sawmill and the flour mill, and factories that produced shingles, rakes and flax, as well as two stores and two hotels. The population was 250.In 1904, Ezra H. Thamer opened New Dundee's first Bell Telephone exchange, the New Dundee Rural Telephone Company, and started a small home-based creamery. By 1908, other investors joined the group, and the creamery became a larger operation, initially as the New Dundee
Farmer’s Cooperative Creamery Company
Ltd.; it was later renamed to the New Dundee Co-Operative Creamery Ltd. The operation became the community's largest industry, processing 140 million pounds of milk in 1964, for example. The business closed in 1998 and the factory was dismantled in 2005.The current New Dundee Public School was built in 1928, with additions in 2008 and 2013.The Dundee Country Club golf course opened in 1970.  Many small businesses are located within the community on Alder Lake and some historic buildings are still standing.
William J. Wintemberg, called by some the "Father of Canadian Archaeology", and an expert on Iroquioan prehistory, was born in the village.


== Geography ==
New Dundee is situated along the Grand River watershed. The local stream is called Alder Creek. Alder Creek flows into the Nith River a few kilometres downstream. The original settlers built the town because of its creek.

The German International School Abu Dhabi (GISAD; German: Deutsche Internationale Schule Abu Dhabi, Arabic: المدرسة الألمانية الدولية) is a German international school located in central Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.The GISAD is certified by the Kultusministerkonferenz (KMK), which is the assembly of ministers of education of the German states. Students at GISAD can attend either Kindergarten, Grundschule, Sekundarstufe I and Sekundarstufe II (kindergarten, primary school, lower secondary level and upper secondary level). 


== The history of the GISAD ==
GISAD was founded in 1976. In 2006/2007, the GISAD was officially recognized as part of the German schools abroad network.


== Language Integration at GISAD ==
The school career path is characterized by the fact that linguistic skills are very specifically promoted as early as in the kindergarten. For some children, the first priority is to become fluent in the German language. In addition, the offer “Arabic for native speakers” begins in kindergarten. The German-speaking children receive language support tailored to their needs with a wide range of educational opportunities and English lessons from the very beginning. From the first grade on, the lessons are German-speaking. Only children who have a good command of German can transfer to the GISAD primary school. However, the GISAD offers additional linguistic support to students with a different first language during and after lessons, this program is called the Lingusitic Integration Program] (LIP). The LIP is tailored such that children without former experience with the German language may integrate into the German school system to attain a German graduate diploma or the "German Language Diploma" (DSD). The DSD enables students who pass the DSD at level B1 and to attend a preparatory course at a German university. GISAD is the only German school in the region that offers the DSD.The LIP is organized so that students can be integrated in one of two ways, depending on their German language background.Entry is possible directly into the classroom environment. Mandatory attendance of a German Intensive Program in the summer and during the school year for academically strong children and who have a German-speaking environment at home and/or previous knowledge of German. This Intensive-Integration package requires an extra language year consisting of German and math in small group. Sports, art, music, and other activities is together with peers of regular classes to have exposure to the German language.For children whose first language is not Arabic, lessons in Arabic as a foreign language also begin in the first grade.GISAD is an all-day school that offers after-school care facilities. The after-school program offers a variety of options, also through cooperation with extra-curricular partners, to relieve parents of after-school supervision and homework assistance.

Davis Collamore & Co. was a high-end New York City importer of porcelain and glass, headed by Davis Collamore (7 October 1820 — 13 August 1887). The firm, rivals to Tiffany & Co. and Black, Starr & Frost,  commissioned designs from Copeland Spode and Thomas Minton Sons, that featured hand-painted details over transfer-printed outlines and often rich gilding. Porcelain by Haviland, Royal Worcester, and Villeroy & Boch also appear with the firm's stamped underglaze marks integrated with the manufacturer's. Davis Collamore was among the first to recognize the beauty and value of American-made cut glass and also offered Rookwood Pottery, for which they were the representatives at the Exposition Universelle, Paris 1889.Davis Collamore, born in Scituate, Massachusetts to a family that had been settled there since 1639, was the youngest of twelve children. At the age of sixteen he moved to New York City to be employed by his brother Ebenezer, an importer of glass and china, at 171 Broadway, with a residence near St. John's Park. In 1842 he established his own business, at 595 Broadway.
His brother Gilman Collamore (1834—1888) came to join him in 1854. Gilman established his own business in 1861. Gilman Collamore & Co., in premises at 731 Broadway in 1861, then occupied premises in Union Square before taking two storeys of showrooms in The Wilbraham, a fashionable block of bachelor flats at Fifth Avenue and 30th Street, that opened in 1890; about 1920 new premises were constructed for the firm at 15 East 56th StreetDavis Collamore & Co.'s premises also matched the moves uptown of fashionable New Yorkers. An ad for tea and dinner services advertised from the firm's early premises, at 479 Broadway, just below Broome Street, appeared in Harper's Weekly, 25 April 1863. Retail shops were opened at Broadway and 21st Street, then on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 37th Street, and then, in 1911, at 48th and Fifth Avenue and finally at 7 and 9 East 52nd Street. There was a branch at the fashionable resort of Newport, Rhode Island.
On November 7, 1842, he married Hannah Augusta Fiske of Boston; they had four children, two of whom died in infancy. Mrs Collamore died on November 13, 1882. As a member of the New York 7th Regiment he was present at the Astor Place Riot of May 1849. In 1864 he purchased seventy acres at Orange, New Jersey and retired to the country house, "Belhurst", he built there on the mountain's slope, to a design by his nephew George Hathorne.

Branscomb is an unincorporated community in Mendocino County in the U.S. state California. It is located 8 miles (13 km) west-southwest of Laytonville, at an elevation of 1565 feet (477 m), on a river terrace to the east of the South Fork Eel River.
The ZIP Code is 95417 and the community is inside area code 707.


== History ==
Benjamin Franklin Branscomb joined an ox-team wagon train that was headed for California in 1857. He was born in Jackson, Ohio, in 1832, the son of Joseph Edmond Branscomb. The family moved to DeKalb County, Missouri, where Joseph became Sheriff. According to family tradition, Joseph, a staunch abolitionist, was shot and killed 3 days before President Lincoln was assassinated, but a contemporary newspaper account says Joseph was shot to death by a Mr. Jacob J. Stoffel in Maysville in July 1865, several months after Lincoln's assassination.Benjamin later settled in Sonoma County and farmed there for about twenty years. He married one of the daughters of the captain of the wagon train, Mary Jane Taylor, and they had 10 children: 6 boys and 4 girls. They moved to Jackson Valley, Mendocino, in 1880, where he homesteaded 160 acres (0.65 km2) of land and 40 acres (160,000 m2) more under the Timber Act. He was instrumental in starting the first school in that area. He built a large home which, after his family grew up, he turned into a hotel. A small grocery store, meat market and livery stable were added later. After more people came into the area, he established a post office, which first opened in 1894. Since the place had no official name, it was named after him, the postmaster. After his death in 1921, one of his sons, John, inherited the property and ran it until 1959, when he sold it to the Harwood family, who built the timber mill in Branscomb called Harwood Products.
Unfortunately in the year 2007 the mill filed bankruptcy, eventually closing its doors for good in 2008. The Branscomb store along with the post office, officially closed few years after in 2016.

Scott County Courthouse is a building in Georgetown, Kentucky, the county seat of Scott County, Kentucky, where county government offices are located. The property was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places on September 28, 1972.


== History ==
Scott County became the state of Kentucky's eleventh county on June 1, 1792, by the newly formed Kentucky Legislature from a section of Woodford County. The county was named  after Charles Scott, an American Revolutionary War general who later was Kentucky's fourth governor.
The first Scott County Courthouse was built in 1792 on a 1-acre (4,000 m2) lot sold to the county by Elijah Craig. The original building was replaced by a larger structure. A third courthouse was built in 1847 after a fire destroyed the second courthouse.  The August 9, 1837, fire destroyed most of the records. A second fire in 1876 again destroyed Scott County courthouse and the fourth courthouse was built. This fourth courthouse remains today but is no longer used for trials but instead other official government affairs.  The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 28, 1972.


== Location ==
The Scott County Courthouse is located in the center of downtown Georgetown, Kentucky at the intersection of Broadway and Main Street, where U.S. Route 25 (Broadway) crosses U.S. Route 460 (Main Street).


== Architecture ==
The 1877 courthouse was designed by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania architect Thomas W. Boyd in the Second Empire style at the cost of $34,600. The distance from the ground to the top of the steeple is 185 feet (56 m).

The 1898–99 season was Burslem Port Vale's fifth season of football in the English Football League; it followed a two-season absence, which the club spent in the Midland Football League. A solid return to the Football League, they finished in mid-table. They had the strongest defence in the division as they conceded less goals than any other team in the division. It was instead a lack of firepower in front of goal that prevented a push for promotion.
Winning their opening six league games, just two points gained from their final five games ensured a top two position was out of their reach. Safety from the lottery of re-election was never in doubt though, as they finished nineteen points above the re-election places. Over the next eight seasons they never bettered their league finish of 1898–99, though they twice equalled it.


== Overview ==


=== Second Division ===
Their FA Cup win over First Division champions Sheffield United in 1897–98 won Vale the respect (and votes) they needed to win re-election to the Football League for 1898–99. To ensure a competitive campaign they signed striker Howard Harvey from Aston Villa for £50. Winning their opening six league games, the semi-professional side conceded just one goal in this run. However, Tommy Clare broke a leg at their final win of the streak of six, and their run ended at Newton Heath the following week – the team badly missed Clare. Their fading hopes of promotion were bolstered by four wins in January, including a 6–1 win over Blackpool aided by a four-goal haul from James Peake. Yet they finished the season with two points from five games, dropping into ninth place – their lowest position all season.Of the two clubs that failed to gain re-election, Darwen, who picked up a League record eighteen consecutive defeats, played regional football for the rest of their existence; whereas Blackpool gained re-election at the end of the following season, and never lost their League status again.
Right-half Lucien Boullemier was an ever-present throughout the campaign, with goalkeeper Herbert Birchenough missing just one game. Winger Billy Heames and forward Howard Harvey rarely missed a game between them.


=== Finances ===
Financially, the club lost £300 over the season.


=== Cup competitions ===
Defending champions of the Staffordshire Senior Cup, Vale reached the semi-final, where they lost 4–0 to Walsall in a replay. In the Birmingham Senior Cup, they defeated Walsall in the semi-final, in a replay, going on to lose 4–0 to Aston Villa in the final. In the FA Cup they were turned over 7–0 at Small Heath in the qualification rounds.

State Route 12 or Scenic Byway 12 (SR-12), also known as "Highway 12 — A Journey Through Time Scenic Byway", is a 123-mile-long (198 km) state highway designated an All-American Road located in Garfield County and Wayne County, Utah, United States.


== Route description ==
Proceeding west to east for 123 miles (nearly 200 km), the highway starts south of Panguitch at an intersection with US-89, crosses part of Dixie National Forest and Bryce Canyon National Park, continues through the small towns of Tropic, Cannonville, and Henrieville. It crosses various parts of Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument (GS-ENM), continues northeast through Escalante and over the Escalante River, then over "The Hogback", a narrow ridge with no guardrails or shoulders and steep drop-offs on each side. It then proceeds north through more of GS-ENM, Boulder, the Aquarius Plateau, and Grover, ending in Torrey at an intersection with SR-24, five miles (8 km) west of Capitol Reef National Park. The 30-mile (48 km) long portion of the highway that ascends and descends Boulder Mountain on the Aquarius Plateau is known as Boulder Mountain Highway.
The segment of SR-12 between the US-89 and SR-63 junctions is part of the National Highway System.


=== Traffic volume ===
The Average Daily Traffic (AADT) on SR-12 is at its greatest at its western junction with US-89, where the count for 2005 was 2,430. At its other end, at the junction with SR-24, the traffic bottoms out at 435.


== History ==
The road from Bryce Canyon Junction to Tropic was added to the state highway system in 1914, and in 1923 a branch from Tropic Junction to Bryce Canyon was built as a forest road. The State Road Commission numbered the route to Bryce Canyon SR-12 in the 1920s, and in 1927 the state legislature assigned it to both branches, to Bryce Canyon and Tropic, but split off the branch to Tropic as State Route 54 in 1931. That same year, a new State Route 120 was created, continuing the road from Tropic to Henrieville, and in 1935 it became part of SR-54. Another road was also added to the state highway system in 1914, connecting SR-22 at Widtsoe with Escalante, and it was numbered State Route 23 in 1927. An extension took SR-23 northeast to Boulder in 1941, and in 1947 SR-54 absorbed SR-23, with the Widtsoe-Escalante road dropped in favor of Henrieville-Escalante. State Route 117, running southeast from SR-24 near Teasdale to Grover, became a state highway in 1931, and was extended south to Boulder in 1957, becoming part of SR-54 in 1966. In 1969, SR-54 became part of SR-12, but most of former SR-117 was dropped, leaving SR-12 to stretch from Bryce Canyon Junction to the north limit of Boulder (at the Dixie National Forest boundary), with a short spur to Bryce Canyon. This spur became a new SR-63 in 1975, and in 1985 the route was extended back north from Boulder to SR-24, using a different route than the old SR-117 north of Grover.

The Department of Computer Science and Technology, formerly the Computer Laboratory, is the computer science department of the University of Cambridge. As of 2023 it employed 56 faculty members, 45 support staff, 105 research staff, and about 205 research students. The current Head of Department is Professor Alastair Beresford.


== History ==
The department was founded as the Mathematical Laboratory under the leadership of John Lennard-Jones on 14 May 1937, though it did not get properly established until after World War II. The new laboratory was housed in the North Wing of the former Anatomy School, on the New Museums Site. Upon its foundation, it was intended "to provide a computing service for general use, and to be a centre for the development of computational techniques in the University". The Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science was the world's first postgraduate taught course in computing, starting in 1953.
In October 1946, work began under Maurice Wilkes on EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator), which subsequently became the world's first fully operational and practical stored program computer when it ran its first program on 6 May 1949. It inspired the world's first business computer, LEO. It was replaced by EDSAC 2, the first microcoded and bitsliced computer, in 1958.
In 1961, David Hartley developed Autocode, one of the first high-level programming languages, for EDSAC 2. Also in that year, proposals for Titan, based on the Ferranti Atlas machine, were developed. Titan became fully operational in 1964 and EDSAC 2 was retired the following year. In 1967, a full ('24/7') multi-user time-shared service for up to 64 users was inaugurated on Titan.
In 1970, the Mathematical Laboratory was renamed the Computer Laboratory, with separate departments for Teaching and Research and the Computing Service, providing computing services to the university and its colleges. The two did not fully separate until 2001, when the Computer Laboratory moved out to the new William Gates building in West Cambridge, off Madingley Road, leaving behind an independent Computing Service.
In 2002, the Computer Laboratory launched the Cambridge Computer Lab Ring, a graduate society named after the Cambridge Ring network.


== Current ==
On 30 June 2017, the Cambridge University Reporter announced that the Computer Laboratory would change its name to the Department of Computer Science and Technology from 1 October 2017, to reflect the broadened scope of its purpose and activities.The department currently offers a 3-year undergraduate course and a 1-year masters course (with a large selection of specialised courses in various research areas). Recent research has focused on virtualisation, security, usability, formal verification, formal semantics of programming languages, computer architecture, natural language processing, mobile computing, wireless networking, biometric identification, robotics, routing, positioning systems and sustainability ("Computing for the future of the planet"). Members have been involved in the creation of many successful UK IT companies such as Acorn, ARM, nCipher and XenSource.


== Staff ==


=== Professors ===
As of 2016, the lab employed 19 professors. Notable ones include:

Other notable staff include Sue Sentance, Robert Watson, Markus Kuhn.

== Impact on business enterprise ==
A number of companies have been founded by staff and graduates. Their names were featured in the new entrance in 2012. Some cited examples of successful companies are ARM, Autonomy, Aveva, CSR and Domino. One common factor they share is that key staff or founder members are "drenched in university training and research". The Cambridge Computer Lab Ring was praised for its "tireless work" by Andy Hopper in 2012, at its tenth anniversary dinner.

Swing Parade of 1946 is a 1946 musical comedy film directed by Phil Karlson and released by Monogram Pictures. The film features Gale Storm, Phil Regan, and The Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard), Edward Brophy and musical numbers by Connee Boswell and the Louis Jordan and Will Osborne orchestras, including "Stormy Weather" and "Caldonia".


== Plot ==
The Three Stooges, as dishwashers, help an aspiring singer, Carol Lawrence (Storm), and a nightclub owner, Danny Warren (Regan), find love.


== Three Stooges appearance ==
The Stooges rework several bits they performed with Ted Healy at MGM: the plumbing sequences are adapted from Meet the Baron and several waiter gags are borrowed from Beer and Pretzels.  Swing Parade of 1946 was filmed over a period of 24 days between July 30 and August 25, 1945.42-year-old Curly Howard had suffered a series of minor strokes several months prior to filming, and his performances in their Columbia shorts at that time were often sluggish and lethargic. By the time of Swing Parade of 1946, he had lost a considerable amount of weight, and had difficulty maintaining his trademark falsetto voice. He appears somewhat more healthy and animated in this film, however, possibly due to The Stooges' supporting roles being less strenuous than in the shorts, where Curly was in virtually every scene. He is also billed as "Jerome Howard" in the credits for the first time in many years, possibly to prepare for some future, non-Curly acting roles.
Director Nicholas Ray worked uncredited on the screenplay. This was Ray's only collaboration with the Three Stooges.
In 2009, the film was lampooned by Rifftrax.

A bookmaker, bookie, or turf accountant is an organization or a person that accepts and pays out bets on sporting and other events at agreed-upon odds.


== History ==
The first bookmaker, Ogden, stood at Newmarket in 1795.


== Range of events ==
Bookmakers in many countries focus on accepting bets on professional sports, especially horse racing and association football or Indian Premier League cricket. However, a wider range of bets, including on political elections, awards ceremonies such as the Oscars, and novelty bets are accepted by bookmakers in some countries.


== Operational procedures ==

By "adjusting the odds" in their favour (paying out amounts using odds that are less than what they determined to be the true odds) or by having a point spread, bookmakers aim to guarantee a profit by achieving a 'balanced book', either by getting an equal number of bets for each possible outcome or (when they are offering odds) by getting the amounts wagered on each outcome to reflect the odds.  When a large bet comes in, a bookmaker may also try to lay off the risk by buying bets from other bookmakers. Bookmakers do not generally attempt to make money from the bets themselves but rather by acting as market makers and profiting from the event regardless of the outcome. Their working methods are similar to those of an actuary, who does a similar balancing of financial outcomes of events for the assurance and insurance industries.


== United Kingdom gambling industry ==

The first bookmaker in the United Kingdom is considered to be Harry Ogden, who opened a business in the 1790s, although similar activities had existed in other forms earlier in the eighteenth century.Following the Gaming Act 1845, the only gambling allowed in the United Kingdom was at race tracks. The introduction of special excursion trains meant that all classes of society could attend the new racecourses opening across the country. Runners working for bookmakers would collect bets in clock bags. Cash flowed to the bookmakers who employed bodyguards against protection gangs operating within the vast crowds. Illegal betting shops were fined, but some, like Bella Thomasson, ran betting businesses that the police appeared to turn a blind eye to.In 1961, Harold Macmillan's Conservative government legalised betting shops, with tough measures enacted to ensure that bookmakers remained honest. A large industry has grown since. At one time, there were over 15,000 betting shops. Now, through consolidation, they have been reduced to between 9,100 and 9,200 in 2013. This number has reduced further to 6,219 as of March 2022, largely as a result of Covid-19 and the forced closure of shops on the UK high street. The group of the largest bookmakers in the country, known as the "Big Three", comprises William Hill, Ladbrokes, and Coral.Improved TV coverage and the modernisation of the law have allowed betting in shops and casinos in most countries. In the UK, on-track bookies still mark up the odds on boards beside the racecourse and use tic-tac or mobile telephones to communicate the odds between their staff and to other bookies, but, with the modernisation of United Kingdom bookmaking laws, online and high street gambling are at an all-time high. A so-called super-casino had been planned for construction in Manchester, but the government announced that this plan had been scrapped on 26 February 2008.


== Germany ==
The law on betting on horse racing and lotteries was passed by the German legislature and came into force on 1 July 2012. Since then, a tax of 5% of the bet must be paid to the tax authorities for all sports betting (offline and online). This affects the entire sports betting market in Germany.


== Canada ==
The fundamental law governing gambling activities in Canada is the federal Criminal Code (the "Code"). Sections 201 to 206, including section 206, make all types of gambling, betting and lotteries illegal throughout Canada with very limited exceptions, such as betting-mutuel on horse racing (provided for in section 204). While the federal Code is the applicable prohibitionist law, all regulations (and regulatory bodies) are provincial, with one exception - pari-mutuel betting on horse racing, which is regulated by the federal Canadian agency Pari-Mutuel. However, this law has many critics, as it is believed that the Canadian sports betting market can generate $25 billion a year.


== United States ==

The Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on online gambling in 2018. However, while online gambling and casinos are legal, each state has its own rules. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the legal bookmakers are DraftKings, FanDuel and Pointsbet. Mississippi, New Jersey, Delaware, Nevada and West Virginia are on the road to legalisation, but Nevada and New Jersey have already passed laws. And most analysts predict the trend towards legalisation of online gambling will continue in more and more US states.


== Internet gambling ==
With the increasing number of online betting exchanges, betting exchanges are now providing free bet offers in an attempt to lure customers away from the competition. These free bets are generally based on the size of the deposit made into the gambling account. For example, if a customer deposited £20, the betting exchange would deposit an additional £20 for the customer to use. Free bet rules vary depending on the betting exchange.
Some bookmakers have even taken to using betting exchanges as a way of laying off unfavourable bets and thus reducing their overall exposure. This has led to insecurity from some TABs in Australia, state-run betting agencies that attempted to deny Betfair an Australian licence by running unfavourable ads in the media regarding the company. When Tasmania granted Betfair a licence despite these efforts, the Western Australian state legislature passed a law that specifically criminalised using betting exchanges from within the state; however, the law was later ruled to be unconstitutional. As a result, internet gambling in Australia required a new legal framework. The Interactive Gambling Act 2001 regulates the online gambling market in Australia, together with all its amendments. The last amendment was introduced on 13 September 2017. This bill states that online casinos, online poker and live betting are illegal in Australia. The Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) is the regulatory body responsible for all supervising online gambling activities. Online sports betting is legal, however.Most televised sports in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe are now sponsored wholly or partly by Internet and high street bookmakers, with sometimes several bookmakers and online casinos being displayed on players' shirts, advertising hoardings, stadium signs and competition event titles. Sponsors are especially highlighted in the football category since football fans present a significant percentage of the bookmakers' target group.Many of the bookmakers are sponsoring some of the major football teams in the major European football leagues, although Werder Bremen are currently fighting the German courts for the freedom to continue featuring bookmaker Bwin on their shirts, as Germany and France take action against online gamers. For example, as of 1 January 2020, Germany bettors will not be able to bet more than €1,000 a month. The latest amendment of the ITG states that. New online sportsbook laws are expected shortly in Germany, as this law is only temporary: the expiration date is set to be on 20 June 2020.The situation is not that strict in France, however. Online sports betting in France is divided into two sections: Autorité de Régulation des Jeux en Ligne (ARJEL) regulates online sports betting, while online horse betting is regulated by the law "Decree 2010-498 from 17 May 2010. International bookmakers are allowed to enter the French market, thanks to the Law No. 2010-476 from 12 May 2010.With the recent banning of tobacco sponsorship and the significant commercial budgets available to the gaming industry, sponsorship by car manufacturers, alcoholic drinks, soft drinks and fast-food marketers is being rapidly replaced by sponsorship from gaming companies in the Far East and Europe.
The United Kingdom's Gambling Act 2005 introduced a new regulatory system for governing gambling in Great Britain. This system includes new provisions for regulating the advertising of gambling products. These provisions of the Act came into effect in September 2007. It is an offence to advertise in the UK, gambling that physically takes place in a non-European Economic Area (EEA) or, in the case of gambling by remote means, gambling that is not regulated by the gambling laws of an EEA state. The Gambling Commission is the body that makes sure all sites and operators follow the new restrictions. In addition to the Gambling Act of 2005, according to the new gambling bill, online gambling sites are only allowed to offer services within the United Kingdom, if they are registered at the UK Gambling Commission.The situation is more confused in the United States, which has attempted to restrict operators of foreign gambling websites from accessing their domestic market. This resulted in 2007 in a ruling against the US government by the World Trade Organization. However, common online gambling laws in the United States still don't exist – it differs from state to state. All forms of online gambling are illegal within the states of Utah and Hawaii, while the states of Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey took a different approach: almost all forms of online gambling are legal in these states. These are the only US states where online casino sites can be legally registered. It is important to mention that Native Americans have their own gambling legislation - the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. However, they need their state's approval to be able to offer their services online.

The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station, also known as the "SCV Sheriff Station," is an American law enforcement agency that serves the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, specifically, Santa Clarita, California. It is part of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD).The station provides a variety of services including correctional programs, disaster services, environmental services, holiday assistance, law enforcement services, substance abuse services, and youth services.


== History ==


=== Origins ===
The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station has a history that dates back to the early 20th century. The original station was initially known as the Newhall Station (not to be confused with Newhall Train Station), which served the law enforcement needs of the Soledad Township and Newhall areas of Santa Clarita for over four decades.The first sub-stations of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, including the Newhall Station, were completed in 1924. As the Santa Clarita Valley grew in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a need for a larger, more modern facility. This led to the dedication of the Santa Clarita Valley Station in 1972, replacing the old Newhall Station.


=== Expansion ===
The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station has continued to evolve and expand over the years to meet the needs of the community. As of 1996, the station employed 162 sworn officers and 26 civilians.In 2021, the former Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station, which was located in the Valencia area of Santa Clarita, officially closed its doors. However, the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff Station continues to serve the community from its new facility, which is located at 26201 Golden Valley Road, Santa Clarita, CA 91350.


=== Events ===
Each year the SCV Sheriff Station hosts an annual toy drive for charity. Another traditional event put on by the SCV Sheriff Station, is its seasonal "Haunted Jail" tours for halloween. The event is targeted towards all ages. Three years ago, the SCV Sheriff's Station began hosting charitable golf tournaments, backed by The SCV Sheriff's Foundation, a non-profit organization founded in 1984.


=== Suicides ===
In 2023, two deputies who worked at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's station died by suicide. The first, was deputy Jonathan Buchan, a 33-year-old former Marine who was found deceased after suffering a self inflicted gunshot wound, while off duty in January 2023.The second, was Commander Darren Harris, a prominent figure at the Santa Clarita Sheriff's Station and the department's chief spokesperson for 25 years, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on November 6, 2023.Harris' death was particularly notable, because he was a well-known figure and tragically, within 48 hours of his death, three other Los Angeles County Sheriff's committed suicide; all dying from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

The Women's javelin throw event at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Daegu Stadium on September 1 and 2.
Barbora Špotáková, the reigning Olympic champion, topped the season's rankings with a throw of 69.45 m. Second-ranked Christina Obergföll had showed greater consistency, having won four of the Diamond League meetings before the championships. Mariya Abakumova, a 2009 World and 2008 Olympic medallist, was ranked third in both the Diamond League and world rankings. Others in good form were Sunette Viljoen (who set an African record two weeks earlier), Martina Ratej, Kathrina Molitor and Goldie Sayers. The 2009 world champion, Steffi Nerius, had retired.
Favorite Špotáková took the early lead, but Abakumova's second throw would lead into the 5th round.  Viljoen improved on her African record in the 5th round, but that was only enough to put her in third place. Špotáková then threw a new World Championship record, only to be passed on the following throw by Abakumova improving on the record and setting a new Russian National Record.
However, in 2018, the Athletics Integrity Unit decided to disqualify Abakumova because of doping, stripping her of the gold medal, which gets inherited by Špotáková.

The Senses and the Intellect is a book by Alexander Bain that was first published in 1855 and published by John William Parker in London. In this treatise, Bain described two principal divisions of the mind, the senses and the intellect. The discussion on the other two aspects of the mind, the emotions and the will, was published by Bain four years later, in 1859, under the title The Emotions and the Will.


== Context ==
Bain had an academic background in moral philosophy and logic and is considered to be an associationist, alongside figures like John Locke, David Hume and his friend - John Stuart Mill.In the early 1840s, Bain developed a keen interest in psychology, particularly in exploring the human senses through physiology. His work during this period culminated in a paper presented in 1844 titled On the definition and classification of the Human Senses, where he introduced the concepts of the muscular sense and organic sensibilities. Drawing from the associationist approach and displaying scepticism towards metaphysics, he expanded contemporary psychology in multiple ways. In the context of the will, he prioritized physiological explanations over metaphysical ones, using reflexes as proof that a type of will exists in human limbs, separate from consciousness. He aimed to identify the physiological links to mental states without adopting materialistic views. By 1851, influenced by Professor Sharpey's lectures on the brain and nervous system, Bain incorporated the idea of the Doctrine of Spontaneity into his writing. Following Sharpey's recommendation, Bain read the studies by French physiologist Longet's, which heavily influenced the first edition of The Senses and the Intellect. Bain's intensive drafting and redrafting continued until 1854. By 1855, with John Stuart Mill's recommended publisher - Parker -  the book was published in June after being meticulously reviewed by Sharpey.


== Contents ==
The first edition of the treatise is 614 pages long and is divided into an introduction and two books.


=== Introduction ===
The introduction is further divided into two chapters. The first chapter defines the mind and ascribes three capacities to it: to feel, to act according to the feeling and to think. The second chapter discusses the nervous system, including the structures of the nerves, the spinal cord, and the encephalon. Bain justifies the need for detailed knowledge of human physiology, as "The Brain is the principal organ of the Mind". By expansion, Bain highlights his goal for a scientific explanation of psychological phenomena by means of physiology.


=== Book 1 - Movement, Sense and Instinct ===
In the first book of The Senses and the Intellect, Bain refers to the "inferior region" of the mind, characterized by fundamental sensations, movements, appetites, and instincts. He justifies this grouping, stating that the concepts he discusses are not significantly linked with higher cognitive processes, making them apt for discussion alongside sensations. Moreover, he argues that a deeper understanding of appetites and instincts enriches the intellectual discourse. The proximity of appetite to sensation and the natural sequencing of discussing all instinctual behaviors before intellectual acquisitions further guide this structure. The first book is organized into four chapters: the first focuses on spontaneous actions and movements; the second delves into the senses and sensations; the third examines appetites; and the fourth addresses instincts, preliminary emotions, and will. Through this structure, Bain aims to cover the foundational mental processes.


=== Book 2 - Intellect ===
In the second book, Bain delves into the study of the intellect, emphasizing its distinctiveness from other mental faculties such as emotion and volition. Bain identifies the intellect's defining feature – the ability to retain and recall sensations and mental states (even without external stimuli), distinguishing it as a capacity to "live both in ideas and actualities". Furthermore, the intellect has the inherent ability to discern and compare conscious states, with an inherent understanding of their agreements and differences. Such cognitive powers underpin acquired abilities and fuel human originality and inventiveness. Bain posits that consciousness might not be essential for all intellectual operations, drawing a clear distinction between it and other mental domains.


== Reception ==
After the release of the book, Bain continued working on the second volume, outlining the remaining aspects of the mind. As Parker was dissatisfied with the sales of The Senses and the Intellect, this became an obstacle for Bain's release of subsequent volume. The dispute was later resolved by Mill who promised to take liability for potential losses that the publisher might incur.In 1876, William James published a review of Bain's works by stating "The thoroughness of the descriptive part of Bain's treatises, and the truly admirable sagacity of many of the psychological analyses and reductions they contain, has made them deservedly classical."Both The Senses and the Intellect and The Emotions and the Will established Bain as a foundational contributor to the newly emerging study of psychology. His insistence on explanations rooted in physiology provided validity to his insights of philosophical origin.Despite mixed receptions, Bain's ideas had a lasting influence. His attempt to bring together psychology and physiology foreshadowed the later development of behaviorism and experimental psychology in the 20th century. The Senses and the Intellect marks a transition from a purely philosophical and introspective approach to psychology.

Steenbeekdries is an uphill cobbled road in the municipality of Maarkedal, in the Belgian province of East Flanders. With its top at 69 m altitude, it is one of many hill formations in the Flemish Ardennes, in the south of East-Flanders. The entire road is paved in cobbles; in 1995 the road of the Steenbeekdries was classified as a protected landscape monument.


== Cycling ==
The site is best known from road bicycle racing, as it regularly features in the spring classics, most notably the Tour of Flanders. The 800 m climb immediately follows the Mariaborrestraat, a long flat sector of cobbles, and at 7.6% average gradient, is not very steep. The descent following the climb, the Stationsberg, is a straight poorly-paved cobbled road and in fact steeper than the Steenbeekdries.The Steenbeekdries was first included in the Tour of Flanders route in 2002 and has remained a fixed location in the race. In recent years, it comes at 39 km from the finish in Oudenaarde, usually the first climb after the notorious Koppenberg.The Steenbeekdries is also regularly included in Dwars door Vlaanderen and the Tour of Flanders for Women.

It has a pointed snout and the dorsal profile of the head is nearly straight. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first containing 8 spines which all have a base of similar thickness and the second dorsal fin has a single spine and 12 or 13 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 11 or 12 soft rays and has a base with is roughly equal in length to that of the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fin has 16 to 18 unbranched rays and has a mean length of one fifth of the standard length and its tip does not extend to the tip of the pelvic fin. This species has 5 pectoral filaments, the first is the shortest and it extends to a point just short of or equal to the origin of the pelvic fin. The second to fourth pectoral filaments do not extends as far as the tip of pelvic fin. The fifth pectoral filament is the longest, having a mean length equivalent to one-third of the standard length and it extends beyond the tip of pelvic fin. The caudal fin is deeply forked with both long caudal fin lobes lacking filaments. There are 60-68 pored scales in the lateral line which is simple and extends from the upper end of gill slit to upper end of the lower lobe of the caudal-fin. The head and upper flanks of the body are silver with a slight blackish tinge. The colour lightens on the lower flanks and the underside is white. The snout is semi-transparent.  The first and second dorsal fins, as well as the caudal fin, are pale with blackish rear margins. The membrane of the pectoral fin is blackish. The pectoral filaments are white. The forward margins and origins of the pelvic and anal fins are white, while their other parts are a dusky yellowish white. This species also has 7 or 8 prominent horizontal dark stripes above the lateral line with 7 to 9 faint stripes below it.

Ridge Racer Accelerated for iOS, SoftBank 006SH with 3D screen and Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet on Android is an arcade racing video game developed by Namco Networks. It is part of the Ridge Racer video game series. The game was released on the App Store, Google Play and Amazon App Store and it uses micro-transactions for unlocking more courses and an extra car class. There are three cars available per class, with six cars more to be unlocked during the game's progress. The game also features an SP1 class consisting of prototype cars. The game features an Arcade, Duel, Survival and Time Attack mode. The game uses the same engine, race courses and menu system from Ridge Racer 2 (PSP).
It features a full motion video opening that stars Reiko Nagase.


== Gameplay ==
The core aspect of the entire Ridge Racer series is drift racing, that is traditional lap racing against opponents with the added twist of intentionally oversteering and sliding the car through sharp corners and turns, known as "drifting", which earns the player several bonuses during a race.
Controlling the car is done by tilting to steer and on screen buttons for accelerating, decelerating and nitrous.
Notable also is the "nitrous boost" system from the previous games in the series. The player has a Nitrous Gauge made up of three nitrous tanks, which at the start of a race are either completely depleted or only partially full. As the player drifts through the corners (especially at very high slip angles) during the race, their nitrous gauge fills up. When the player fills up one of the three nitrous tanks, it can be activated to achieve a temporary speed boost. The nitrous tanks cannot be recharged while any tank is in use though, but the residual speed increase when the nitrous boost expires can be used just before entering corners to recharge the player's nitrous tanks at a faster rate than normal.
The game features 8 unique courses (16 when played in reverse) with 3 more (6 when played in reverse) that can be bought in-game, all taken from previous PlayStation games. Including purchased courses (forward and reversed), the total number of tracks comes to 22.
The cars in the game include six classes, each increasing in speed and difficulty. There is a seventh (Special) class.
The game features 48 cars (referred to as machines), based on 12 basic models. Each class of cars has nine cars, six of which have to be unlocked. The Special Class has only three cars, one of which is available to drive right away. Including purchased cars, the total rides comes to 57.


== Music ==
The music in the game is a collection of tracks taken from the PSP version of Ridge Racer. Players can also listen to their own personal music library stored on their iPod/iPhone.


== Reception ==

The game received "mixed" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
